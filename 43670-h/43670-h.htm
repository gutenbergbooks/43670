<h1 id='t58'>I—JOHN TUCKERMAN COMES TO BARMOUTH</h1>

<p>Tom Hallett lived in an old town on the
Atlantic seaboard, a port of New Hampshire that
was wedged in between the rocky coast of Maine
and the sandy beaches of Massachusetts. If he
crossed the broad river to the north, the beautiful
Pesumpscot, by the old toll-bridge that seemed as
ancient as the town itself, he came into the Pine
Tree State. If he sailed to the south, he had not
far to go before he reached Cape Ann. Back of
him, to the west, lay the foothills of the White
Mountains, and he had often tramped far enough
in that direction to see the noble outline of Mount
Washington rise grandly against the sky. In
front—for people who live along the seacoast always
think of the ocean as being at their front door—was
the harbor of Barmouth, a wide semi-circle,
its two horns sticking way out to the east, its broad
bosom dotted with many islands. Once Barmouth
town had sent many ships to sea, merchantmen to
the West Indies, around Cape Horn, to the fabled
lands of India and China, fishing fleets to the Grand
Banks off Newfoundland, whalers to the Arctic;
now, however, ships were not so plentiful, sails had
given place to steam, and the young men stayed
ashore to make their living rather than seek the
rigors and gales that were a part of the toll exacted
by Father Neptune.</p>

<p>Tom Hallett’s house had the cupola on top of
its roof that told of the old sailing days, the
“widow’s watch,” as it was commonly called, for
from there the wives of sailors used to watch for
the first sign of homebound sails. His grandfather
had been a sea-captain, and the house was full of the
treasures he had collected. Many a time Tom and
his older sister Milly had listened to the amazing
yarns the weatherbeaten mariner had spun by the
winter fire.</p>

<p>Barmouth was an excellent place for a boy to
live. There was plenty of lawn around most of the
houses, the streets were wide and well-shaded, open
country was near enough to be reached by a ten-minute
walk. There was coasting and skating in
winter—all that one could wish—and the ponds that
rang with the music of steel runners in January
were swimming-holes in July and tempting places
to fish. And there was always the harbor and the
wind from the sea, calling young sailors to
launch their dories and try their skill over the
rippling waves.</p>

<p>Tom was sixteen that summer, and wanted something
to do—something a little different from his
usual holiday jaunts. He told his father about it,
and his father said he would think the matter over.
And then one evening, as Tom was leaning on the
garden gate, wishing that some adventure would
come his way, he found himself addressed by
a stranger.</p>

<p>“Do you know of a young fellow out of a
job?” said the stranger. “A likely young fellow,
who doesn’t mind roughing it?”</p>

<p>Tom regarded the man. The latter was tall
and spare, and wore big, horn-rimmed spectacles
that gave him the look of a wise and thoughtful owl.</p>

<p>“Maybe I do, and maybe I don’t,” Tom
answered, copying the cautious words and tone of
voice that he had often heard his uncle Samuel
Jordan, who was a lawyer, use when he was
asked questions.</p>

<p>“You’re Yankee through and through, aren’t
you?” said the man. “You don’t want to commit
yourself to anything definite until you know all
the facts. I don’t suppose I could interest you in
buying a calico horse until you’d got out a pail of
water and soap and a scrubbing brush to see if
the spots would wash off.”</p>

<p>Tom laughed; the stranger looked so extremely
solemn in his big glasses, and yet his tone indicated
a joke. “Even if the spots didn’t wash off I’m not
sure you could interest me in that horse,” he retorted.
“I don’t see how I could use him just now.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s not for sale, my friend. I need
him out on the old farm in Illinois, where I come
from.” The man stroked his chin while he regarded
Tom reflectively. “I’m looking for a young and
able seaman, for to tell you the truth, I don’t know
much about salt water. I provide the grub and the
boat and whatever else is needed, and the sailorman
provides the lore of the sea.”</p>

<p>Tom’s interest was aroused. If this stranger
really wanted a sailor to help him with a boat it
seemed odd that he should be seeking information
from a young fellow lounging on a gate in one of
the quiet, elm-shaded streets of Barmouth. It
would have been much more natural to look for
such information along the waterfront, at some of
the docks or piers. “Why don’t you hunt up one
of the captains?” Tom suggested. “They might
know just the man for you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want a man,” was the answer. “I
want a likely young fellow, someone about your
age and general cut of jib—that’s the right seafaring
expression, isn’t it? I’ve got an adventure
on hand, and I want company. I wouldn’t mind
two, or even three, young fellows, if they were the
right kind.”</p>

<p>An adventure! Tom pricked up his ears. The
man was certainly interesting, he would like to know
more about him. “Where are you going to sail,
and how long would you be away?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“My cruise will probably be limited to the
islands in Barmouth Harbor, and we’d be away
anywhere from a week to a month.”</p>

<p>“Well,” began Tom, “I don’t know——”</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” said the stranger, with a grin.
“There are a number of things I don’t know about
this adventure. But then the main point about an
adventure is that we can’t tell everything about it in
advance. Isn’t that so?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is,” Tom granted. And after a
moment’s thought he added, “I know my way round
the harbor pretty well, and I can sail a dory, and
I’ve got a couple of friends——”</p>

<p>“Fine!” declared the man. “Do you know,
it may seem odd to you, but as I came along the
street and my eyes lighted on you, I said to myself,
‘that’s precisely the type of messmate I’m looking
for; an upstanding fellow, with a good head on
his shoulders.’”</p>

<p>Naturally Tom felt pleased. He straightened
up and stuck his hands in his pockets. “The only
thing I don’t understand,” he said, “is how you
expect to find a real adventure in the harbor. Of
course we could cruise around, and fish and swim.
Is that what you had in mind?”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of Cotterell’s Island?”
The stranger lowered his voice.</p>

<p>Tom nodded. “Of course I have. We call it
Crusty Christopher’s Island around here.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever been on it?”</p>

<p>“No,” Tom was forced to admit. “The
man who lives there won’t let any one land.
He’s put up signs warning people off and he
keeps watch-dogs.”</p>

<p>“The island belongs to me,” announced the
stranger, “and I’m going to camp out on it.”</p>

<p>Tom stared at the man in surprise. “But surely
you’re not Crusty Christopher!” he exclaimed. “I
always heard he was old and had a white beard.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Christopher Cotterell,” explained the
stranger, “was my uncle; though as a matter of
fact I only saw him once, when I was a small boy.
He died last year and I have inherited his island
and the house on it. The house has a history. I’m
very much interested in old houses, and particularly
in this one. My name is John Tuckerman.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tom, “that’s interesting, to be
sure. I hope you don’t think I meant to call your
uncle names.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, you didn’t offend me,” said the
man promptly. “I’ve heard him called Crusty
Christopher before, and I shouldn’t wonder if he
deserved the nickname. There have been a number
of queer characters in the Cotterell family; there
was old Sir Peter Cotterell, for instance, who built
that house on the island and lived there during
the Revolution.”</p>

<p>“Sir Peter?” queried Tom. “I don’t seem to
remember him.”</p>

<p>“He wasn’t really Sir Peter,” Mr. Tuckerman
explained. “He was only plain Mr. Peter, like his
neighbors in Barmouth. But he had the bad taste
to side with the King of England when the colonists
objected to paying taxes without being represented
in the government—in other words, he was what
they called a Tory—and so the people nicknamed
him Sir Peter in joke. There are lots of stories I
could tell you about him. I’m very much interested
in history, you see.”</p>

<p>Tom nodded. The more he listened to this
Mr. John Tuckerman the more he liked him. And
yet simply to camp out on an island in the harbor,
even on Cotterell’s Island, where he had never set
his foot—though he had often wanted to—didn’t
strike him as a very thrilling adventure.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mr. Tuckerman read his thought, for,
lowering his voice again, he said, “There’s a mystery
connected with the place; I’ve found references
to it in some old family letters. And the house is
full of old furniture and bric-a-brac. I can hardly
wait to explore it.”</p>

<p>The man’s tone was undoubtedly eager, and
though Tom had never felt any great interest in old
furniture and such things he found his curiosity
rapidly rising. An island and a house to explore—Crusty
Christopher’s at that—and possibly a mystery.
He might be making a great mistake if he
let this adventure escape.</p>

<p>Mr. Tuckerman was speaking again. “I might
as well explain at once that I’m a dreadful landlubber.
I don’t know anything about sailing boats,
and not very much about fishing. I’m afraid my
education has been very much neglected along certain
lines. I want to camp on that island, and I want
company. Do you know how to cook—to cook the
sort of things campers eat, I mean?”</p>

<p>“I can cook some things. But my friend
David Norton can cook almost anything. He’s one
of the fellows I meant.”</p>

<p>“It would be splendid if we could get David,
too. I’d take along plenty of provisions, but one
does get tired of living on canned things.”</p>

<p>“Ben Sully’s a corking fisherman,” said Tom.
“Ben and David and I have camped out a
lot together.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to keep the expedition as quiet as I
can,” Mr. Tuckerman stated. “I don’t want a lot of
curiosity-seekers poking round the island.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re right,” agreed Tom. “I’ll
swear both of them to secrecy; except to their families,
of course. You wouldn’t mind our telling
our parents?”</p>

<p>To that John Tuckerman agreed. “This is just
what I hoped to find,” he said, “some young fellows
with the spirit of adventure. You know the ropes,
and I don’t. Let’s see; what’s your name?”</p>

<p>Tom told him. “Wouldn’t you like to come in
and see my father?” he suggested.</p>

<p>“I must be getting back to the hotel,” said
Tuckerman. “You tell him my name, and say
I’m Mr. Cotterell’s nephew. You sign up to go,
do you? And you’ll try to get your two messmates?
I’ll see to the boat and grub and cooking
outfit—and I think I can promise you a bit of adventure.”</p>

<p>“If Father says yes, I sign,” agreed Tom, smiling
at the man’s air of business. “And the more
adventure there is, the better I’ll like it, too. Things
are sort of quiet here this summer.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman held out his hand. He had a
formal manner about him that amused Tom
greatly. “See you at Lowe’s Wharf at two o’clock
tomorrow afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Right,” said Tom, shaking hands. “And I’ll
have the other two fellows there with me. They’ve
always wanted to have a look at that island.”</p>

<p>The tall, lank man turned, and shortly disappeared
behind the big clump of lilac bushes at the
corner of Wentworth Street. Tom, thoughtfully
jingling a bunch of keys in his trouser pocket,
chuckled as he considered the situation. In fifteen
minutes this Mr. John Tuckerman, a total stranger,
had persuaded him to camp out for a fortnight or so
on Crusty Christopher’s island. Tom could well
believe that Mr. Tuckerman needed some companions
who were used to the water and campcraft; he looked
as if he might be a Professor and more knowing
about history and such things than about how to
reef a sail or hook a flounder.</p>

<p>Still grinning at this unusual happening, Tom
went into the house, where in the sitting-room his
father was reading, his mother sewing, and his
sister Milly trimming a new straw hat. “I’m
going camping on Cotterell’s Island,” he declared.
“It’s a sort of a secret, so you must all promise
not to tell.”</p>

<p>Milly looked up quickly. “On Cotterell’s Island?
If you step ashore there, somebody’ll pitch you off.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, they won’t. I’m going with the owner.”</p>

<p>Milly wrinkled her nose, as she did when she
felt scornful. “I suppose that pleasant old man
has sent you an invitation. ‘Dear Mr. Thomas
Hallett, I should be <span class='it'>so</span> delighted if you’d drop in on
me.’” And Milly tilted the straw hat on her hand
so as to judge the effect of the ribbon around
the brim.</p>

<p>Tom walked across to the fireplace, where he
stood with his back to the hearth, as his father
often did when he had an announcement to make.
“Mr. Christopher Cotterell is dead,” he said. “I
received my invitation from his nephew, Mr.
John Tuckerman.”</p>

<p>Milly turned around, surprised. “What are
you springing on us? Where did you meet
this man?”</p>

<p>“Down at the gate to-night,” said Tom calmly.
“He wanted a likely young fellow to help him
explore the house and the island he’s inherited, and
naturally he came to me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, what Tom says is quite true,” declared
Mr. Hallett. “Mr. Tuckerman is the new owner.
So he asked you to help him, did he?”</p>

<p>“He called himself a landlubber. I’ve an idea
too that he doesn’t want to stay on the island alone.
I’m to get Ben and David, and we’re to sail his
boat for him and fish and cook and keep
him company.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” sniffed Milly. “That doesn’t
sound very exciting. You’re to do the work while
he loafs around.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know about that. He hinted that
we might find something very interesting. He
called it an adventure. And he let slip something
about a mystery.”</p>

<p>Milly put the hat down. She herself was very
fond of camping and sailing and swimming, and
although she pretended to be quite grown up she still
yearned at times for her old tomboy ways. “I
suppose he isn’t going to be like Old Crusty—I
mean Mr. Christopher Cotterell? He won’t mind
people coming out to see that queer old house.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what he does mind,” said Tom.
“He wants to keep the whole thing dark, for the
present, at least. Why, if he didn’t, all Barmouth
would be going out there. Most of them never got
nearer the place than to read the signs; and they’d
all be crazy to go.”</p>

<p>“Well, it seems to me,” argued Milly, “if he’s
going to explore the house he ought to have someone
out there who knows something about furnishings.
I daresay there’s lots of old silver and curtains and
rugs and maybe chests of fine linen. Now of
course a woman—well, it’s only natural that a
woman—you know what I mean, a woman could
help a great deal in sorting such things out.”</p>

<p>“When you say a woman,” inquired Tom, “do
you happen to be thinking of Miss Milly Hallett?”</p>

<p>Milly, in spite of her tan, flushed a fiery red.
“You know perfectly well, Tom, that you’ve always
said I was a great help on a camping party.”</p>

<p>“So you are, Milly,” Tom admitted loyally.
“You cook better even than Dave does. But Mr.
Tuckerman didn’t say anything about bringing a
girl along. I’m afraid he’d think that wouldn’t
be business-like.”</p>

<p>“Tom’s right, Milly dear,” said Mrs. Hallett.
“This is Mr. Tuckerman’s affair, and it wouldn’t
be right to offer him any suggestions. But perhaps,
while they’re out on the island, he wouldn’t mind
if some day we went over to look at the house.
When do you start, Tom?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow at two—that is, if father says it’s
all right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re going to ask my consent, are you?”
said Mr. Hallett, with a smile. “Well, if Mr.
Tuckerman is such a landlubber as he appears to
be, I think it’s only right you should give him your
help. I don’t see how, with Ben and David and
you, he can possibly get into hot water.”</p>

<p>“He can’t,” agreed Milly, picking up the hat
again and pretending to shiver. “The water isn’t
even warm around the islands in the harbor.
However, I don’t suppose this Mr. Tuckerman is apt to
care much for swimming.” And as she went on
twirling the hat in her hands and puffing out the big
blue bow, she hummed a little tune to indicate that
she was much more interested in her millinery than
in Tom’s prospective adventure.</p>

<p>Tom walked down the street to the small,
pitched-roof house—a white house with green shutters
and door, and tall pink and red hollyhocks
standing up against the sides—where Benjamin
Sully lived. As luck would have it, David Norton
was sitting with Ben on the doorstep. “Hello!”
cried Tom. “I’m looking for a couple of able-bodied
seamen.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir,” answered Ben. “What port
are you bound for—the Barbary Coast or Barbadoes
or round the Cape of Good Hope?”</p>

<p>Ben was a small, dark boy, agile as a monkey.
When he was with David Norton he looked smaller
and darker than ever, for David was big of frame
and his sandy hair topped a cheerful, freckled face.
These two and Tom Hallett were about of an age,
and had always shared each other’s secrets.</p>

<p>“Cotterell’s Island, lads. A place where the
foot of a white man has never set heel before.”
And standing in front of his two friends, Tom
related John Tuckerman’s proposal.</p>

<p>When he had finished, Ben nodded. “The plan
sounds good to me. I’ve always meant to have a
look at that island. As I’ve sized it up, Crusty
Christopher wouldn’t have been so concerned to
keep people away if he hadn’t had something he
wanted to keep secret.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said David. “Some
people are made that way; they just naturally don’t
want other folks around. Maybe the place is just
like any other island.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going anyhow,” declared Tom. “I
guess I can look after Mr. Tuckerman all right by
myself. But I didn’t want to seem mean and leave
you two out.”</p>

<p>Ben jumped up. “I’m going, all right. I’d hate
to think of you and that ignorant fellow out there
all by yourselves. Count me in on this, Tom.”</p>

<p>“I guess your friend wouldn’t get much good
cooking,” said David, “without me to superintend.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know about that,” retorted Tom.
“He’s going to take plenty of good stuff.”</p>

<p>“Canned!” snorted David. “I know—hardtack
and beans out of a tin. No, siree. You’d be
squabbling inside of two days if you didn’t have
me and some of my famous flapjacks to keep
you pleasant.”</p>

<p>“Nice, modest David,” said Ben, stroking his
big friend’s arm. “However, though he doesn’t
think very well of himself, I vote that we let him
come along. Maybe he’ll be useful.”</p>

<p>“You bet I’ll come,” announced the tow-headed
one. “Do you think I’d let you two and a queer
man go prowling around a mysterious island without
your Uncle David? I’ll be there when the
boat sails, with my pet frying-pan!”</p>

<h1 id='t552'>II—COTTERELL’S ISLAND</h1>

<p>Early the next afternoon the few occupants of
Lowe’s Wharf—a couple of men fishing for cunners,
a sailor painting the bottom of an upturned dory,
two small boys practising tying various kinds of
knots with odds and ends of rope—saw three young
fellows in dark blue jerseys and khaki coats and
trousers and a man rigged out in a homespun Norfolk
jacket and knickerbockers and greenish-gray
golf stockings assemble as if they were about to
start on an expedition.</p>

<p>Tom Hallett, slender but wiry, browned by the
wind and the sun, dumped his duffle-bag of blankets
and extra clothing on the wharf and introduced his
companions. “Mr. Tuckerman, this is David
Norton, and this is Ben Sully. They’d both like to
go along, if you still want three of us.”</p>

<p>John Tuckerman shook hands with each. “I’m
proud to have such a fine looking crew,” said he.
“Though perhaps I ought to put it the other way
about and say three such fine looking captains, I
myself being the crew. It doesn’t need more than
a glance to tell me that you three know all about the
sea and the woods. Great luck, I call it. And if
I’m not mistaken there’s our ship, waiting for us
Argonauts to go aboard.”</p>

<p>At one side of the wharf, a man was holding the
painter of an eighteen-foot sailing dory, already
loaded with provisions and John Tuckerman’s bags.
The three boys quickly had their own things stowed
away. “All right, Mr. Jackson,” said Tuckerman
to the man from whom he had rented the boat.
“You see I’ve shipped a good crew. You needn’t
lie awake nights wondering what’s happened to
your <span class='it'>Argo</span>.”</p>

<p>The owner grinned. “I know ’em. I’ll trust
’em with the boat. But her name’s the <span class='it'>Mary J.
Jackson</span>. See, it’s painted there in the bow.”</p>

<p>“So it is. <span class='it'>Mary J. Jackson</span>. That’s a very nice
name; but somehow it doesn’t seem exactly to suit
this business. We’re after the Golden Fleece, like
the Argonauts of old; so if you don’t mind I’m going
to christen her for this trip the <span class='it'>Argo</span>. Just a little
fancy of mine.”</p>

<p>“Suit yerself, sir. She’s a good boat, no matter
what you call her.”</p>

<p>“Many thanks, Mr. Jackson.” John Tuckerman
sat down carefully. “Now, Captain Hallett, give
your orders.”</p>

<p>The dory slid away, the experienced hand of Tom
in charge of the tiller. Out into the harbor she
sped, picking up the breeze as she danced along.</p>

<p>The afternoon sun was pleasantly warm, the
water was translucent blue, with here and there wide
sweeps of green, on the shore every house and tree
stood out in vivid, fresh-tinted color. Tuckerman
folded his arms and leaned back in great contentment.
“This is something like, my lads!” he
exclaimed. “My voyages heretofore have only
been made on ocean grayhounds and fat-bodied
ferry-boats.”</p>

<p>Ben looked at him pityingly. “It must be pretty
hard,” he said, “to live inland, in a big city.”</p>

<p>“Yes, in some ways, though it has its compensations.
You see, my ancestors grew restless in New
England and moved out across the plains. That is,
the Tuckermans did; the Cotterells stayed here. And
now there aren’t any Cotterells left. That’s how it
came about that I own this island.”</p>

<p>“My father,” spoke up David, “says that the
Cotterells were once one of the best known families
in Barmouth; but that old Mr. Christopher was as
queer as all get out. He knows lots of stories
about him. He says that Mr. Christopher lived
there with a colored man for his servant, and never
saw anybody.”</p>

<p>“Poor old chap!” said Tuckerman. “I can’t
help feeling dreadfully sorry for him. Think what
a good time he could have had in his big house.
Why, in the old days it was one of the show places
along the coast and the Cotterells used to have celebrated
parties.” Tuckerman gazed out over the
water and pulled his chin with his fingers, in a habit
he had. “Do you know what I want to do? I
want to take that old house and fix it up properly,
make it look as it used to, and give it back its good
name.” He smiled. “Maybe you’ll think it odd,
but I feel as if houses were almost like people. I hate
to see either the one or the other go to seed.”</p>

<p>“They are something like people,” Ben agreed.
“There’s a church with a steeple in Barmouth that
looks just like the pictures of the Pilgrim Fathers
with their high-crowned hats. And the windows in
front look like eyes, kind of boring eyes that are
trying to see right through you.”</p>

<p>“Ben’s always thinking of queer things like
that,” David explained, half in apology.</p>

<p>Mr. Tuckerman nodded at the small, dark-browed
boy. “I’m glad that Ben came along. I think he’s
going to be a great help in fixing up my house.”</p>

<p>In and out between islands, past long jutting
ledges, where pine and juniper ran down to the
water’s edge, the dory sailed smoothly. Sometimes
Tom had to tack; again he ran for a stretch on a
course due south. And after about an hour he raised
his arm and pointed. “There—on the port bow—there
she lies. See that white, sandy beach. That’s
Cotterell’s Island.”</p>

<p>Ben and David were familiar with the look of the
place of course; they had cruised around it many
times, and had always examined it with particular
interest because it was a forbidden shore; but now
they gazed at it as though it were somehow entirely
new, as indeed it was to them, except for the beach
and trees.</p>

<p>John Tuckerman nodded. “I’ll take your word
for it, Tom. It lies exactly where it should according
to the map of the harbor; though I can’t say that it
looks very much like the small red dot on the chart
Mr. Jackson showed me at his boathouse.”</p>

<p>There was not much to be seen except the whitish-yellow
beach, several headlands of purple rock, and
thick-growing pines that stood out black-green.
There was, however, considerable to be heard as the
sailing dory drew near. An immense cawing came
from the tree-tops, and finally as the <span class='it'>Argo</span> nosed
along close to the shore at least a score of crows
flapped away from their meeting-place and went
winging off to a more secluded grove.</p>

<p>“Uncle Christopher’s neighbors don’t seem to
like visitors any better than he did,” observed
Tuckerman with twinkling eyes. “Crows do sound
dreadfully scolding, don’t they? And I never knew
such birds for all wanting to talk at the same time.”</p>

<p>Tom knew where the old pier stood, and brought
his boat skilfully up to the landing-stage. The sail
was dropped and furled, baggage and stores carried
ashore, and the four campers looked about them.
From the old and rather decrepit pier a graveled path
led up to the front of a wide white house, partially
screened by trees.</p>

<p>“Cotterell Hall,” said Tuckerman, gazing at the
ancient mansion. “That’s what they used to call it
in Revolutionary days. Well, Tom, it’s up to you to
tell us what to do. The house won’t run away, and
something tells me it won’t be so very long before
we’ll be hungry.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we look for our camping ground
then,” said Tom, “since it seems to be understood
that we’re not going to bunk in the house.”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea,” agreed Tuckerman promptly.
“Fond as I am of ancestral halls and that sort of
thing, I said to myself when I left the Middle-West
for the New England coast: ‘John, you’re to sleep
out of doors on a bed of pine boughs, even if the
bugs do fall from the trees on your face and the
boughs stick you as full of needles as a porcupine.
You’re going back to the wild, that’s what you are!’”</p>

<p>His eyes behind his huge tortoise-shell rimmed
spectacles looked so intensely serious that the three
boys didn’t know whether to laugh or not. For all
his dignified appearance he did seem extraordinarily
guileless. David, the most outspoken of the three,
shook his head solemnly. “This isn’t going to be
what you’d call so all-fired wild, you know. If
you’re looking for that, you ought to go up in the
North Woods.”</p>

<p>Ben came to the rescue. “It’ll do as a starter
though, Mr. Tuckerman,” he said encouragingly.
“We can’t promise you bears or anything like that,
but maybe there’ll be owls and loons and other things
that sound sort of strange at night.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman smiled. “Ben, I can see you’re a
friendly soul. And you must remember that what
may not seem very wild to experienced woodsmen
like you three may prove very thrilling to a tenderfoot
like me.”</p>

<p>They decided on their camp readily; a smooth
stretch of turf in a semi-circle of pines on high
ground just above a small sandy beach. It was perhaps
a quarter of a mile from the pier and from
Cotterell Hall. Pine boughs were cut, trimmed, and
spread out for bedding, stores were unpacked, driftwood
collected for a fire, and the menu determined
on for supper.</p>

<p>Tuckerman looked out at the water, a sheet of
soft and beautiful opalescent colors in the setting
sun. “Is there any reason why we shouldn’t take
a bath?” he inquired. “I feel extremely sticky.”</p>

<p>“No reason whatever,” answered Tom. “The
first rule of camp-life is, Obey that impulse. There’s
plenty of room in that bathtub, but you won’t find
much hot water.”</p>

<p>In five minutes they were all in the ocean, frisky
as a school of porpoises, making enough noise to
scare any wildfowl away. The boys struck out and
swam, trying first one stroke and then another.
Tuckerman, however, came lumbering along, jerking
his arms and legs like an old and stiff-jointed frog.
But he enjoyed himself. He was chuckling and gurgling
and slapping his thighs with his hands as they
all came out of the water.</p>

<p>“Tom, you must teach me to swim,” he begged.
“I can see I’m not in your class now, but give me a
week or so——”</p>

<p>“Righto. I bet you’ll learn quick.”</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes they were ready for supper.
Fried eggs and bacon, grilled sweet potatoes, coffee,
bread and butter, and then flapjacks with jam. “I
can see,” said Tuckerman, as he finished his third
flapjack, “that David’s reputation as a cook has not
been exaggerated. I always wondered what it meant
when I read that the gods lived on ambrosia and
nectar. Now at last I know.”</p>

<p>“You’ll make his head swell,” cautioned Ben,
“and it’s large enough already. We took him to
a phrenologist last winter, and the man said he’d
never felt such big bumps.”</p>

<p>The dishes were washed. The moon rose.
Tuckerman lighted his pipe. “Well,” said Ben,
“aren’t we going to have a look at the old house?
It seems to me we ought.”</p>

<p>The house, when they approached it a little later
in the moonlight—for Ben’s suggestion had met with
favor from the others—presented a blank and shuttered
white surface, against which the dark outline
of the trees around it showed in jagged forms. It
had been a fine old dwelling, built in a day when
carpenters and joiners took a real love in their work
and were as eager to make a graceful, artistic window
or doorway as the medieval masons of Europe were
to perfect every detail of their great cathedrals.</p>

<p>Broad steps led up to the front door, which was
wide and adorned with a big brass knocker and
knob. Tuckerman, taking a little electric flashlight
from his pocket, aimed it at the moulding above the
door. “Aha,” he exclaimed, “there’s the green and
gold pineapple in all its glory! They used to put
beautifully carved pineapples like that in such places
in colonial days; they were the emblems of hospitality.
My ancestor Sir Peter seems to have been
friendly disposed when he built his dwelling at least.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen pineapples like that over the doors of
some old houses in Barmouth,” said Ben, “but I
never thought much about them. That was a pretty
nice idea. There’s some style to that front.”</p>

<p>“There was style, real dignified style to the
houses of those days,” Tuckerman agreed. “We
may think we’re pretty smart nowadays, but let me
tell you those ancestors of ours who settled the country
could teach us a good deal.” He felt in his pocket
for a key. “Well, the pineapple bids us welcome.
If there are any ghosts in the house, I think they’ll
turn out friendly.”</p>

<p>The lock was rusty, but finally opened to the new
owner’s efforts. They stepped into a large hallway,
from which a wide stairway ascended at one side.
Using his flashlight, Tuckerman discovered a gatelegged
table, on which stood a cluster of small candlesticks,
all ready for use.</p>

<p>“Now that’s something like—hospitality again!”
he declared in a pleased voice. “They used candles
in the old days; every guest in the house had one
to light him to bed. I suppose these have been waiting
for me here ever since Uncle Christopher died.”
Lighting the candles with a match, he handed one
to each of his companions. “I’m beginning to feel
at home already, boys. Welcome to Cotterell Hall.”</p>

<p>Even David, who could see nothing very thrilling
in going over an old house, felt something of the
excitement that had so obviously taken possession of
John Tuckerman. As for Tom and Ben, they peered
up the stairway and through the open doors as if
they half-expected to see gentlemen in curled wigs,
knee-breeches and small swords advancing to
meet them.</p>

<p>Tuckerman led the way into the room on the
left, a spacious apartment, wainscoted and with a
pictured paper, representing scenes in fields and
woods, covering the walls to the ceiling. There was
a large fireplace, with a carved mantel above it. Fine
old pieces of furniture filled the room, and, except
for the musty air that is to be found in all houses
that have been closed for some time, the place looked
precisely as though it were lived in, even to a pile
of magazines and books that lay on the centre-table.</p>

<p>“The drawing-room,” said Tuckerman, holding
his candle high as he gazed about him. “And there,
if I’m not mistaken, is old Sir Peter himself.”</p>

<p>Ben gave a start and looked quickly around. But
it was not a ghost to which Tuckerman referred; it
was a large painting that hung on the wall across
from the fireplace, the portrait of a man in buff-colored
coat and breeches, wearing a white tie-wig,
and with his right hand resting on the head of a
greyhound that rubbed against his knees.</p>

<p>“Fine looking old fellow,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Tuckerman. “Sir Peter was
really handsome. I’ve seen pictures of him before.
He was a great beau in his time, before the Revolution.
What a shame it was that he couldn’t agree
with his neighbors about the right of the colonies
to be free. That made it mighty hard for his wife
and children.”</p>

<p>He went over to look closer at the portrait, and as
he held the candle near to the canvas he saw a folded
piece of paper stuck into a corner of the heavy
frame. “What’s this?” he exclaimed, and drew
the paper out. “You don’t suppose the old fellow
has left me a message?”</p>

<p>The candle set on the table, Tuckerman opened
the sheet. “This is an authentic portrait of Peter
Cotterell, painted in 1770,” he read aloud. “He
shared with me, his descendant, Christopher Cotterell,
a dislike for the society of his kind, though for a
different reason. But with me the line of the
Cotterells comes to an end, and I care not whether
any now learn my ancestor’s secret or not.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman dropped the paper. “So there was a
secret, boys! You remember, Tom, what I told you.
And Uncle Christopher knew what it was.”</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed Ben. “My candle’s blown
out!” He turned. “Why, that window’s open a
little at the bottom. See how the curtains blow.”</p>

<p>“Spooks,” scoffed David. “It looks to me as if
Crusty Christopher were playing a joke on us.”</p>

<h1 id='t934'>III—BEN AND DAVID MAKE A DISCOVERY</h1>

<p>Although David Norton could get around the
bases on the Barmouth High School baseball diamond
as fast as anyone else, when there was need
of it, and could keep on doing a clog-dance in a
Minstrel Show until the audience rose up and begged
him to quit, he could also at times be as lazy as a
jelly-fish stranded on the beach, which as everyone
knows is just about the laziest creature in nature.
At the present moment he lay extended on the stern
seat of the sailing dory, while little Ben Sully, as
patient and expert a fisherman as was to be found
in Barmouth Harbor, was watching his line for any
indication of a flounder nibble.</p>

<p>“Funny old bird,” said David. “Reminds me
of someone out of a story book.”</p>

<p>“Old bird?” queried Ben. “Do you refer to
Sir Peter Cotterell or to Crusty Christopher?”</p>

<p>“To neither of them, Benjie. Our friend Professor
Tuckerman is the particular feathered creature
to whom I was alluding. I opened one eye last night;
and what do you think I saw? Professor Tuckerman
was sitting up, in his suit of flannel pajamas, staring
out at the water as if he saw something.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he did. Or maybe he was only thinking.
Some people do think sometimes, you know,
Dave. I did some thinking myself last night.”</p>

<p>“About old Christopher’s secret?”</p>

<p>At the moment Ben was too busy to reply. With
practised care he drew up his line and threw a fine,
flapping flounder on the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>“Yes, about the secret,” Ben said, as he rebaited
his hook. “I believe there is one. And I think
that Christopher Cotterell rather hoped his nephew
John Tuckerman would find out what it was.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he tell him then, instead of leaving
that crazy note?”</p>

<p>Ben shook his head. “Christopher wasn’t like
most people. But it seems to me he was rather
proud of that secret,—it had been in the family so
long,—and he didn’t want it to be entirely forgotten.
So he meant to let it be known there was a secret,
even if nobody ever found out what it was. A
person might do that, you know.”</p>

<p>“It would take a mighty queer sort of person,”
sniffed David.</p>

<p>Ben resumed his fishing, watching his line as a
cat watches a mouse-hole.</p>

<p>But David, in spite of posing as an unbeliever of
all things he couldn’t see for himself, had a well-developed
bump of curiosity. When he saw that
Ben didn’t mean to continue the subject he raised
himself on one arm and demanded, “Do you take
any stock in there being a mystery on the island that
goes back to the Revolution?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” was the prompt answer. “The house
goes back that far, and some of the furniture in it,
I suppose. Why not a mystery?”</p>

<p>“Well, it might, perhaps. But see here,
Benjie——”</p>

<p>“Sh-sh-ish, you’ll frighten the fish.” Ben
brought up another flounder and unhooked it.</p>

<p>As he dropped in the line again he continued,
“Mr. Tuckerman told me a few things this morning.
You see, this Sir Peter was a man of means. He had
a lot of valuable things in this house, silver and such
things he’d had brought over from England. When
the people of Barmouth were trying to do all they
could to help George Washington and his army they
thought their rich neighbor out here ought to do his
share. But he was a Tory and wanted King George
to win, and so he wouldn’t do anything when they
asked him. The colonists came to his house, but
they found very little; his famous silver plate was
gone; they took some things, but they always thought
he had tricked them. And after that they wouldn’t
have anything to do with Sir Peter.”</p>

<p>“Served him right, the old scamp.”</p>

<p>“Now Mr. Tuckerman thinks the secret may
have something to do with the things the neighbors
couldn’t find. At least that’s a possibility.”</p>

<p>“Huh,” chuckled David, “the Revolution was
more than a hundred years ago. If that was the
secret, some of the Cotterells since then would have
found out about it. And when they did, there’s an
end to the secret.”</p>

<p>Again Ben was busy. A third flounder appeared
and was carefully landed. “You’re right, my boy,”
said Ben, “if they did find out what became of Sir
Peter’s valuables. But suppose they didn’t? Suppose
Crusty Christopher and his father, and his
father before that, knew the old story, but never
could find the things? How about that, my lad?”</p>

<p>“Well, in that case,” answered David slowly,
“I should say the betting was a thousand to one the
secret would stay a secret.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Tuckerman calls it a sporting chance,” said
Ben. “I said to him just about what you’ve said
to me now; but he grinned and told me he never
gave up conundrums.”</p>

<p>David dropped back into his former comfortable
position, his hands clasped under his head and his
cap pulled down over his nose, so as to shield that
sensitive feature from burning a more fiery red than
it was already. “So Tom and the Professor are
prowling around the old house this morning?” he
said reflectively. “Well, they’re not apt to run into
any ghosts at this time of day.”</p>

<p>Ben, absorbed in his fishing, continued his careful
handling of his line until half-a-dozen flounders
were deposited in the boat. Then he stowed away his
tackle, stretched his arms, and looked around.
“Now, Dave, you old duffer, I’m going to take a
cruise about our island home. There’s nothing like
knowing all the ins and outs of the place where
you’re living. Do you think you’re strong enough to
handle the tiller, or would you rather dangle your
feet over the bow?”</p>

<p>David sat up with a grunt. “Don’t you get sarcastic,
young feller. I can sail this dory with one
hand behind my back.” And shortly he had the <span class='it'>Argo</span>
headed up into the wind, keeping well out from
shore so as to avoid the occasional spits of rock that
ornamented the coast.</p>

<p>They started to make the circuit. Cotterell’s
Island, so far as they could judge from the water,
was very much like all the other islands that lay out
from Barmouth, thickly wooded for the most part,
with alternating beaches and headlands, and here and
there a cliff, with little rock-bound basins at the foot.
On the eastward side, however, there was an opening,
where the tide ran inland for some distance, a fair
sort of harbor except when the wind should blow
from that quarter. “There,” said Ben, “there’s a
snug landlocked channel. If I’d been one of the
Cotterells and wanted to keep a boat hidden that’s
the place I’d have picked out.”</p>

<p>“You’re making the Professor’s ancestors sound
like pirates or smugglers,” objected David. “What
do you think they did that they wanted to keep
so dark?”</p>

<p>“That little inlet can’t be so far from the back
of the house either,” Ben went on, paying no attention
to his companion’s question. “Yes, that would
be the place to steal away when the neighbors came
to call.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take a look up there,” declared David, who
was beginning to feel that Ben was giving himself
airs. “I guess I can find my way up that inlet as
well as any of your blessed Cotterells could.” And
suiting the act to the word, he brought the <span class='it'>Argo</span>
about and kept her bow a little to the north of west
until she had cleared a seaweed-covered reef that was
high up out of the water at ebb-tide.</p>

<p>Ben said not a word, but picked up a boathook,
in case it should be necessary to fend off the dory
at some turn of the shore. But David knew his
business. Up the winding channel he made his way
until the <span class='it'>Argo’s</span> bottom gently ran on to gravel at
the head of the stream.</p>

<p>“Yes, I was right,” said Ben. “There’s the
roof of the house on the other side of those trees.”
A leap, and he landed on shore, the dory careening
on one side from the force of his jump.</p>

<p>“Hi there, young feller, what are you trying to
do?” cried David. “I didn’t tell you you could
go ashore.”</p>

<p>Again Ben paid no attention to the other’s words.
He was looking about him as if he was very much
interested in the place where he had landed.</p>

<p>David, making sure the <span class='it'>Argo</span> was safely aground,
clambered over the side. “Was it your intention,
Mr. Sully, to scuttle our good ship here?” he inquired
with mock politeness.</p>

<p>“Look,” said Ben, in a deep and earnest tone.</p>

<p>David looked. In the marshy ground a little in
front of them were two distinct footprints, uncommonly
large footprints, with very wide toes and very
deep heels.</p>

<p>“My word!” whistled David. “Benjie, we’ve
come to the lair of the mastodon!”</p>

<p>“Footprints!” murmured Ben, regarding the
marks with the same awed surprise with which
Robinson Crusoe first gazed at the prints in the sand
of his island.</p>

<div class='imgcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-048.jpg' alt='' id='img2'/>
<p class='caption'>Distinct Footprints</p>
</div>

<p>“A giant’s footprints,” said David.</p>

<p>“They’re never Mr. Tuckerman’s or Tom’s,”
said Ben.</p>

<p>“The Professor has rather small feet,” stated
David, “and I happen to remember that Tom wore
sneakers this morning.”</p>

<p>“They can’t have been there very long,—not for
more than a few days at the most.”</p>

<p>“I should say not. Benjamin, somebody has
been trespassing on our island.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if there are any more.” Ben began
to search.</p>

<p>There were no more footprints, however. The
stretch of soggy ground was very limited, almost
immediately the soil grew stony. So, after a brief
hunt, the two came back to the shore. “Now I
wonder,” mused Ben, “what that very large-footed
person was doing here.”</p>

<p>“Do you think,” asked David, “he can have been
looking for the Cotterell treasure?”</p>

<p>“It’s much more likely,” said Ben, “he was
looking for something easier to find.
However—suppose—there’s an off chance——” And Ben went
on mumbling to himself, while he jingled a bunch of
keys in his pocket, as was his custom when he was
lost in thought.</p>

<p>“What in the world are you doing?” demanded
the exasperated David.</p>

<p>“Putting two and two together—or at least
trying to.”</p>

<p>“Well, they make four. There are times,
Benjie,” David continued, imitating the manner of
a teacher at the school they both attended, “when I
find myself almost on the point of losing patience
with you. The crew will now return aboard the
<span class='it'>Argo</span>, leaving the mystery of the mastodon’s footprints
unsolved.”</p>

<p>When they returned to the beach in front of
their camp they found Mr. Tuckerman and Tom
already getting dinner. That is to say, Tom was
actually getting it, while John Tuckerman was carrying
out his orders. At the moment the latter was
peeling potatoes. His flannel shirt open at his
throat, his golf-stockings stuck full of little burrs
and his face and arms already showing blisters of
sunburn, he looked decidedly different from the very
dignified person who had come upon Tom Hallett
in the lane.</p>

<p>“Flounders,” announced Ben, laying his string
of fish on a board that served as a table. “The very
best eating, in my humble opinion.”</p>

<p>“Put them in the refrigerator for supper,” said
Tom. “You two were gone so long I decided to
knock up an omelette for our midday meal.”</p>

<p>“‘Knock up’ is good,” agreed David. “I suppose,
Mr. Tuckerman, Tom cracked the shells with a
baseball bat.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how he did it,” Tuckerman said;
“it seemed like a miracle to me. But there’s the
result; and if anybody ever saw anything more truly
beautiful—anything so calculated to make the mouth
water in anticipation—well, I don’t believe anybody
ever did.” He pointed his paring knife at a golden-brown,
crisp object that lay, garnished with watercress,
on a big tin plate.</p>

<p>“And speaking of water,” said Tom, “we found
the well back of Cotterell Hall. Fresh water, guaranteed
sweet and pure. There’s a bucket of it.”</p>

<p>They sat down to dinner, and between mouthfuls
they talked.</p>

<p>“Wonderful old house,” said Tom. “We
explored it from cellar to attic. Four post
bedsteads——”</p>

<p>“With wonderful canopy tops!” added Tuckerman,
his spectacled eyes gleaming.</p>

<p>“And enormous chests of drawers,” continued
Tom.</p>

<p>“Full of all kinds of clothes,” Tuckerman
added. “Ladies’ laces and muslins, shawls, mantillas,
gentlemen’s pantaloons, neckerchiefs, and
what waistcoats!”</p>

<p>“Funny old kitchen,” said Tom. “With a fireplace
as big as a cabin.”</p>

<p>“And a crane and a hob and a whole fleet of
earthenware crocks,” Tuckerman supplemented.</p>

<p>“I say, Mr. Tuckerman,” cried David, “why
don’t you turn the place into a museum? All the
people who tour through Barmouth in the summer
would jump out of their skins to see such a place
as that.”</p>

<p>“What I want to know,” said Ben, “is whether
you got any clue to the Cotterell treasure.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman shook his head. “Rome wasn’t built
in a day, Benjamin; and a treasure that’s been hidden
for over a century doesn’t come to light in
twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>“Ah, just you wait till our Benjie gets busy,”
said David, waving his finger wisely. “There’s the
bright lad for you. While you two pottered about
those gigantic bedsteads and chests of drawers and
fireplaces, what did our Benjie discover?” He
paused to heighten his announcement. “Benjamin
Sully discovered a pair of gigantic footprints!”</p>

<p>It took a moment for this to sink in.</p>

<p>“Footprints?” said Tuckerman, puzzled.</p>

<p>“Someone has landed at the little creek near
the back of the house,” explained Ben, “and since
the last rain, too.”</p>

<p>“Someone with enormous feet,” added David.
“Now what do you suppose such a person as that
could be doing here?”</p>

<p>Tuckerman put his hand into his coat pocket
and drew out a very small and crumpled handkerchief.
“We found this on a table in the kitchen.
My Uncle Christopher only had a negro man-servant.
And yet this belonged to a lady,—a very
particular lady, I should say, a dainty lady.” He
spread the handkerchief out. “With beautifully
embroidered initials—A. S. L.” He lifted it to his
nose. “And it smells of lavender—and quite
fresh, too.”</p>

<p>Solemnly the tiny handkerchief was handed
around. Each smelled it and nodded his head.</p>

<p>“Someone’s been in the house,” said Tuckerman,
“although all the doors were locked.”</p>

<p>“A lady with enormous feet,” declared David.
“My eye, how the plot thickens!”</p>

<h1 id='t1327'>IV—VISITORS</h1>

<p>Two days later the campers were as much at sea
as ever regarding the secret to which Crusty Christopher
had referred in the note left in the picture
frame. They had explored the island and they had
explored the house, and neither outdoors nor indoors
had provided them with a clue.</p>

<p>John Tuckerman—although David persisted in
calling him Professor—was the most exuberant and
lively of the four. He delighted in everything,—in
the early swim before breakfast, in the cooking and
eating, especially in the eating, in sleeping out of
doors, and even, it seemed, in washing the dishes.
He would sing as he washed, wild, rollicking songs,
the words of which he made up as he went along,
all about pirates and sailors and sea-serpents, with a
great many “Yo-heave-hos” and “Blow the man
down, my lads,” by way of chorus; all which he
accompanied with a pretended hitching up of his
trousers as sailors were supposed to do to cheer them
at their work.</p>

<p>“There are times when he almost looks like a
pirate,” David whispered to Tom, as they watched
Tuckerman sharpening a knife on the sole of his
shoe preparatory to sticking it into a cover of a can
of baked beans. “Like a pirate, that is, with one
exception,—those horn-rimmed spectacles.”</p>

<p>It was true; Tuckerman couldn’t look like a daredevil
with those enormous glasses. But to offset the
studious look they gave him his face was now a
beautiful lobster-like red and beginning to peel.</p>

<p>Any one could see, moreover, that Cotterell Hall
was the apple of his eye. It amused Tom and David
to see the affection and pride with which he regarded
every stick and stone of the old house. Ben was
more sympathetic, for Ben was by nature interested
in old things, and had in turn collected everything
from abandoned bird’s nests to rusty jackknives.</p>

<p>It was Ben who, searching through a cupboard
at one side of the fireplace in the front room at the
Hall, pulled out a package of old letters and gave a
shout of joy. “Hi there, see what I’ve found!”
he cried as he untied the bundle and threw the envelopes
loosely on the table.</p>

<p>“What is it? Old letters,” said Tom, glancing
at the yellowing paper.</p>

<p>“Postage stamps!” triumphed Ben. “Some of
the earliest issues! I’ll bet you never saw that St.
Louis stamp with the two bears on it before.”</p>

<p>“Humph,” said David. “Postage stamps! No
one collects them now.”</p>

<p>But John Tuckerman looked over Ben’s shoulder,
and then snatched up one of the letters. “You’re
right, Benjamin. These are rare ones. I shouldn’t
wonder if they were worth a great deal of money.”</p>

<p>It was not, however, the money value of the
things in the house that interested Tuckerman. It
was partly his love of old things, especially of things
that were beautifully made, and partly his feeling
that they had belonged to the Cotterells for so long,
the Cotterells being his own people. “Uncle Christopher
owned all these things,” he said. “Poor Uncle
Christopher. He was stiff-necked, no doubt; but he
had to suffer for it. I’ve found a book he wrote in,
and I can see that he was too proud to sell his heirlooms,
and that he had very little money, and didn’t
want anyone to know how hard up he was. So he
turned hermit. He didn’t really hate other people;
he was simply so made up that he couldn’t mix with
them on an equal footing.”</p>

<p>David pretended to regard the Cotterell family
secret as a great joke, although he admitted that he
was very much puzzled over what he called “the
mystery of the lady with enormous feet.” On the
same afternoon when Ben found the rare postage
stamps, David, being alone with Tom in the front
room, cocked an eye at the painted gentleman on the
wall, and thus addressed him:</p>

<p>“Sir Peter, I don’t want to be disrespectful; but
it does seem to me you were mighty tight with your
silver when your good neighbors were doing their
best to get the thirteen United States started. Or
didn’t you really have the things they suspected you
of having? You’ve got a long nose and a twinkle
in your eye, and I’d say it mightn’t be beyond you
to have your little game at the expense of Barmouth.”</p>

<p>Tom laughed. “You can’t judge Sir Peter by
yourself, Dave.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” was the instant reply. “I’ll
admit we are very different. Nothing could induce
me to have my picture taken with a dog like that
greyhound cuddling up against my shins. The good
people of Barmouth didn’t have any greyhounds or
any pie crust tables or gate-legged tables, or whatever
kind of tables it is that the Professor finds so delightful,
and they were envious, and rowed their boats
out here, and tramped up to the door, probably
looking for all the world like a gang of hayseeds.”</p>

<p>“Remember, Dave, your ancestors and mine were
probably among them.”</p>

<p>“I’ll admit that also,” said David, “and for the
sake of your feelings, Tom, I’ll take back that about
their looking like hayseeds. Let me put it this way.
A crowd of very nice looking, but temporarily cross
and angry people—men and women, and possibly a
few dogs—come up to the house here and demand
to see the elegant Sir Peter. Sir Peter doesn’t want
to see them; he doesn’t approve of them; he thinks
that good old King George is just about the proper
cheese to rule over him and his. But Sir Peter’s a
gentleman—you can see that from his portrait—and
he doesn’t want to disappoint the neighbors, who’ve
come all the way out here in boats. So he takes a
pinch of snuff and he whistles to his greyhound and
he goes out on the front steps. He looks down along
his nose at the people of Barmouth and his right eye
twinkles—you notice, Tom, that it’s his right eye
that’s the humorous one—and he says: ‘Friends and
fellow citizens, come in and enjoy yourselves. The
green and gold pineapple is over the door and
Cotterell Hall is yours for the afternoon. But the
silver plate you’re so anxious to lay your hands on
isn’t here any more. It’s vanished, vamoosed, flown
away; and the family are using the plain blue and
white china kitchen set.’ Did they believe him?”</p>

<p>“No,” sang out Tom.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” agreed David, with a bow. “They
rushed past him into the house, and they threw things
about, and they buzzed around like a nest of hornets
you happen to hit with a stick. But they didn’t find
anything after all; and the reason is simple—there
wasn’t anything of the sort they had in mind to find.
It was just Sir Peter’s little joke. And it worked
to perfection. Ever since people have been wondering
what he did with the silverware he mentioned
that day. Sir Peter, my opinion of you is that you
were a first-class joker.”</p>

<p>“You may be right,” Tom assented, “but for
goodness’ sake don’t rub that idea in on Mr. Tuckerman
and Ben. They’re thrilled to the fingertips about
there being a treasure hidden away somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Babes in the wood!” sniffed David. “I believe
you could put almost anything over on the
Professor if you dressed it up in old clothes.”</p>

<p>To the skeptical David and the inclined-to-be-skeptical
Tom the other two now appeared. They
had been in the apartment on the second floor that
had been Christopher Cotterell’s bedroom and had
been rummaging through a little secretary that stood
between the windows. Tuckerman had a notebook in
his hand. “These are jottings my uncle made from
time to time,” he declared. “Here’s one. ‘As regards
the saying that the hiding-place is just beyond
the three pines that stand between two rocks where
the sun goes down, I have scoured and scoured the
island, and come to the opinion that the extreme
southwestern point must be the place intended,
although to-day there are only two pines there. I
have dug at this place, but found only sand.’”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can find another place that answers
that description,” said Ben hopefully. “And it
stands to reason that the four of us can dig better
than your Uncle Christopher, even if he had his
servant to help him.”</p>

<p>David, under cover of his hand, winked at Tom,
who pretended not to see him.</p>

<p>“Here’s another note,” Tuckerman continued.
“‘Find the mahogany-hued man with the long,
skinny legs and look in his breast pocket.’ That’s
a saying my father handed down. What can
it mean?”</p>

<p>“Mahogany-hued man with long, skinny legs,”
echoed Ben.</p>

<p>“And a hooked nose and a scar across the left
cheek,” chortled David. “Pirate stuff, of course.
There’s always someone like that. I suppose he’s the
fellow who hid the treasure on a dark, stormy night.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman gazed at the speaker with his big,
owl-like eyes. “You may be right, although I rather
thought of him as a faithful, old-fashioned serving-man,
from whom Sir Peter had no secrets.”</p>

<p>David grinned; but how could anyone joke on a
matter that Tuckerman took so seriously? “Have
it your own way,” he said. “Probably you’re right.
But hooked-nose pirate or faithful servant I don’t see
how the mahogany one can be of much help to us
here to-day.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman closed the notebook. “Suppose we
go down to the southwestern point. At least we’ll
get a good view of the sunset and freshen up
for supper.”</p>

<p>When they came to that end of the island they
found the ledges and neighboring sand covered with
a vast array of sandpipers, all with their heads turned
in the same direction, watching, as it were, a score or
so of leaders, who stood out in front, closest to the
water. Quietly though the four crept up, they were
still a couple of dozen yards from the rear ranks
when, with one accord and with as smooth a motion
as though a sail were being drawn across the beach,
the hundreds of little winged bodies rose in air
and flew out across the waves.</p>

<p>“By Jove, that’s pretty!” said Tom. “They’re
like ever so many bits of silver paper blowing about
in the wind.”</p>

<p>So they were. Fascinated, the four watched the
sandpipers. When the birds were tilted one way,
on one tack, they could hardly be seen against the
light, they actually disappeared. Then a tiny
deflection, a dip and twist of the wings, and they were a
network of silver, drawn this way, then that. They
wheeled, they rose, they dropped; no human beings
ever moved in such perfect precision; it was not as
if they followed a leader, it was as if every single
sandpiper of the hundreds knew instinctively what
the bird just ahead of him would do. And at last
they descended, like falling leaves, on a flat rock out
in the water.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how they can do it,” sighed Ben.
“We could drill and drill forever, and never get anything
like that. Don’t tell me that sandpipers
haven’t brains.”</p>

<p>“You bet your boots they have,” said David.
“Fine little fellows! I don’t see how anybody can
possibly want to shoot them.”</p>

<p>The little fellows rose again and went soaring
off against the sunset sky.</p>

<p>Tuckerman drew a long breath. “You boys
who live by the seashore have much to be thankful
for. The pioneers who pushed inland must have been
awfully homesick for just such sights as that. Gee
whillikins! What a gorgeous sky! I could look at
it for hours.”</p>

<p>His companions, however, had other things to do.
They wanted to locate the two pines that stood
between the two rocks. A short search discovered
them. The trees, old and gnarled, twisted of
branches on the eastern side, where the winter winds
had lashed them, still stood like sentinels between
the lichen-covered boulders, where Christopher
Cotterell and doubtless others before him back to the
days of Peter had surveyed them.</p>

<p>“They’re here all right,” said Ben. “What was
it the notebook said? ‘I have dug at this place,
but found only sand.’ Well, there’s plenty of
sand—oodles of it. But if you ask my opinion, this
isn’t the place to dig.”</p>

<p>“You’re lazy,” scoffed David. “Tell me, Mr.
Man, why in your learned opinion isn’t this the right
place to dig?”</p>

<p>“I’ve a hunch it isn’t,” answered Ben.</p>

<p>Tuckerman looked at the serious-faced small fellow,
and suddenly gave a laugh. “I’ve got the same
sort of a hunch myself. My uncle Christopher dug
here and didn’t find anything. I don’t want to do
his work all over again.”</p>

<p>They let it go at that, and slowly, with an eye
to the sunset, which every moment grew more like a
vast palette on which many colors were mixed, went
back by the path through the woods that skirted the
western shore. They reached the old house, and
were passing it on their way to the camp when Tom
abruptly halted. “I say, I saw something moving
at that corner window on the second floor! Something
white—yes, sir, it moved. I’ll take my word
to that!”</p>

<p>All stopped and gazed at the house. The
windows were closed, no curtain could have
been blowing.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said David. “What you saw was
the sunset reflected on the glass.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it wasn’t,” Tom retorted. And straightway
he went up the graveled walk that led to the
front door.</p>

<p>Now usually John Tuckerman had been careful
to lock the door when he left the house, but this
time he had forgotten. Tom turned the knob and
pushed the door open.</p>

<p>They all went into the hall and stood there listening.
Undoubtedly there was the sound of footsteps
on the floor above.</p>

<p>“That sounds to me like a giggle,” whispered
Ben.</p>

<p>“Sh-ssh,” warned David.</p>

<p>Footsteps tapped on the floor, were coming apparently
toward the head of the staircase.</p>

<p>Then unmistakably there was a laugh, a light and
merry laugh, in a feminine key.</p>

<p>In the silence that followed David’s voice rose.
“The lady with the enormous feet!” he muttered.</p>

<p>A patter of feet and there came into view two
ladies, two ladies in hoopskirts, with white stockings
and little black slippers laced with black ribbons, and
flowered silk waists and flat, mushroom-shaped hats
with streamers falling behind. They stood at the
head of the staircase and stared down at the
four below.</p>

<p>“It’s Milly and Sally Hooper!” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>“Did I hear someone whisper ‘The lady with
the enormous feet?’” Milly Hallett wrinkled her
nose and stuck out the tip of her tongue. “Sarah, my
dear, the gentlemen aren’t so gallant as they used
to be. Whoever saw neater, sweeter slippers than
these we have on!”</p>

<p>Slowly, with a hand to each side of their skirts,
which swayed like great balloons, the two girls came
down the stairs.</p>

<p>At the foot John Tuckerman stood, bowing.
“Ladies, you greatly honor my poor house,” he
declared.</p>

<p>“Who is the gentleman, Milly?” asked Sarah
Hooper, a black-haired, black-eyed girl with scarlet
ribbons to her hat.</p>

<p>“Faith, I think it must be one of the comely
Cotterells,” said Milly. “What a fine sunburn
he has!”</p>

<p>“John Tuckerman, at your service,” said that
gentleman. “Nephew of Mr. Christopher.”</p>

<p>Milly Hallett’s blue eyes danced with delightful
mischief. “And Mr. Tuckerman, who are the three
extraordinary young persons standing in a row behind
you? They do look so funny! Such remarkable
clothes.”</p>

<p>David looked at Ben, and Ben looked at Tom, and
Tom looked down at his khaki trousers, which still
bore patches of white and green paint acquired a
month ago when he was freshening up his canoe.</p>

<p>“Ladies, these are three experts,” Tuckerman
explained. “The gentleman with the yellow hair
and the zebra stripes on his trousers is an expert
skipper, the one with the midnight hair and the rich
mahogany skin is an expert fisherman, and the
third—with the splendid red complexion and the curling
locks—can cook a meal that will make you forget
every other breakfast or dinner or supper you ever
sat down to.”</p>

<p>“Really!” exclaimed Sarah. “Milly dear,
something reminds me that it’s a long time since we
tasted food.”</p>

<p>“I was just about to touch on that point,” said
Tuckerman. “Will you do us the honor of breaking
bread with us? That is, if you won’t injure your
exquisite gowns by eating out of doors.”</p>

<p>“They can’t sit on the grass in those things,”
Tom declared. “They’d ruin them for fair.”</p>

<p>“Oh, can’t we!” cried Milly and Sarah in chorus.
“Just you watch us do it!”</p>

<p>And in spite of hoopskirts and tiny slippers and
gingerly-perched hats the two girls ran to the front
door and down the steps to the path. The other four,
catching up with them, piloted them to camp.</p>

<p>On the way Milly explained. She had felt that
she just had to find out what was going on at
Cotterell’s Island—she had feared that bears or
ghosts, mosquitoes or robbers might have made an
end of her brother and his friends; so she had gotten
Sally Hooper, and they had taken Sally’s father’s sailboat
and sailed out to the island. They hadn’t seen
the boys; but when they went up to the white house
they found the front door unlocked. They went in
and looked the place all over. In a room on the
second floor they found oceans of clothes in chests
and closets, and they simply had to try some of
them on. Then they thought they’d surprise the
campers. And they certainly had done that, she concluded,
because she had never seen four people look
so astonished as those four had when they saw Sally
and her come to the top of the stairs.</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes supper was under way, a truly
marvellous supper, for David was determined to
show these skeptical girls what a howling cook he
was. The guests were not allowed to soil their
fingers; as a matter of fact they found they had their
hands full with trying to manage their ridiculous
hoopskirts and sit down in them without smashing
the hoops. But they did contrive to seat themselves
on a grassy bank, and Milly took off her slippers—which
were horribly tight—and the two watched
their four serving-men get supper, and occasionally
put in a word or so of advice.</p>

<p>When each of the six had declared that they could
not possibly eat a single additional pancake—no matter
how much golden syrup was offered as an extra
inducement—supper came to a conclusion, and Milly
cast a reflective eye out on the water.</p>

<p>“Sally and I must be starting back,” she said
with a sigh; “and I don’t suppose they’d let us land
in Barmouth, dressed in these funny old clothes.”</p>

<p>Sarah Hooper looked at David, who sat cross-legged
on the ground, resting after his labors.
“You’re a very superior chef,” she admitted; “but
I want to know what you meant when you heard us
upstairs and murmured, ‘The lady with the enormous
feet.’ Oh yes, I heard you; and those were
the very words you used.”</p>

<p>David laughed. “I plead guilty. But I didn’t
refer to either you or Milly. I was thinking of a
little detective work we have on hand.”</p>

<p>Then he had to explain about the discovery of the
very large footprints on the bank of the creek and
the finding of a lady’s lavender-scented handkerchief,
with the initials A. S. L., in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Oh, I love mysteries!” said Sarah. “I’m
always reading detective stories and working them
out before the author tells you exactly what
did happen.”</p>

<p>“There’s the man for you then,” said David,
pointing at Ben. “Eats ’em alive, he does.”</p>

<p>“Huge footprints and a lady’s handkerchief,”
murmured Milly. “That is a funny combination.
But we really must go, or Sally’s mother and father
will be sending out searching parties.”</p>

<p>They all walked back to the house, and the two
girls went upstairs to change into their own clothes.
When they came down again, much more comfortably
dressed, they found the others in the big front
room, where Tuckerman had lighted the candles.</p>

<p>“How lovely!” exclaimed the romantic Sarah.
“I adore old furniture. What a duck of a divan!
And that beautiful secretary.” She looked at a desk
that stood in a corner, at the other end from the fireplace.
“It’s mahogany, of course—and what perfect,
long, fluted, shiny legs it has!”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” said Ben. “Say it again,
and slower.”</p>

<p>“I tell you we must be going back,” declared
Milly positively. “Never mind these ducky old
things, Sally. Think of your waiting parents.”</p>

<p>So Sally had to go, and they all trooped down to
the pier, where Mr. Hooper’s sailboat was bobbing
about on the tide.</p>

<p>Tom insisted that he would take the <span class='it'>Argo</span>, to convoy
the girls home; but Milly also insisted that he
should do nothing of the kind; she knew how to
handle a boat quite as well as her brother, the wind
was right, the water smooth, and she had often
sailed later in the evening than that. Nevertheless
when Milly’s boat was out from the island, the
campers embarked in the <span class='it'>Argo</span> and sailed along after
them, until the lights of Barmouth were visible right
ahead. Then, with a good-night shout, the crew
of the <span class='it'>Argo</span> brought their craft about and headed
back for the pier.</p>

<p>They walked through the moonlit woods to their
camp, cleaned the dishes, and made things snug for
the night. As Ben, seated on a log, pulled off his
shoes, he said to Tom, who sat near him:
“Did you hear what Sally said about that desk
in the corner?”</p>

<p>“Duck of a thing—some such nonsense.”</p>

<p>“No. She said, ‘Mahogany, of course. And
what long, fluted, shiny legs.’”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she did. I don’t remember.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t that convey anything to your mind,
Tom?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say it does. Mahogany—legs. Oh, I’m
too sleepy to think of anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, it conveys something to me,” said Ben.
“I think maybe I’ve got a clue, thanks to innocent
Sally. I suppose it’s too late to go back to the
house to-night?”</p>

<p>“It’s too late to go anywhere except to sleep,”
answered Tom shortly. “I guess your clue will keep.
If it’s got anything to do with Sir Peter’s treasure,
it’s kept for a hundred years.”</p>

<p>Tom gave a gigantic yawn, and rolled over on to
his bed.</p>

<p>But Ben lay awake for some time, until he got
the sound of the lapping of waves on the beach mixed
with John Tuckerman’s voice singing “Yo—heave—ho,
my lads,” and then he fell asleep.</p>

<h1 id='t1894'>V—THE MAHOGANY MAN</h1>

<p>Mr. Tuckerman was doing the crawl-stroke—slowly
and laboriously, with almost as much splashing
as a small paddle-wheel steamboat makes—but
still very much better than he had been able to do it
two days before. He was heading toward a rock,
on which Tom, straight as an arrow and almost as
brown as a chocolate drop, stood with his arms
pointed outward, ready to dive.</p>

<p>Ben stood back of Tom, slapping his dripping
thighs and hopping about on his toes. In the water
David was floating, as comfortable and serene as a
harbor seal taking an afternoon nap. “Look out,
Professor,” he cautioned; “Tom might land on your
head. He’s a terrible practical joker. Don’t you
let him use you as a cushion.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman plowed along, gasping a little, his
eyes fixed on the rock.</p>

<p>Tom dove, and came up alongside David. “If
I was picking out a cushion, I’d take you. You’d
make a bully springboard. Push right along, Mr.
Tuckerman. You’re doing nobly.”</p>

<p>Ben gave a whoop. “Look out there!” Lithe
as an eel, and seemingly made of rubber, he sprang
from the rock, turned a somersault, and shot
smoothly into the water. He reappeared, looking
like a porpoise, his black hair all shiny, and with a
few lusty flaps reached the rock again just as
Tuckerman, breathless, put out his hands to clutch
at the slippery side.</p>

<p>“You’re a regular flying-fish,” Ben complimented
Tuckerman, as the latter, careful not to
scrape too close against the rough edge of rock, drew
himself slowly up to the level top. “I don’t believe
any of your friends out in the plain country of
Illinois would know you if they happened to see
you now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they would,” agreed Tuckerman,
sitting down gingerly and embracing his knees with
his hands. “I know I look like a red Indian, and I
feel as if I’d got a thousand more muscles than I
ever had before.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind——” said Ben; and putting
his hands on Tuckerman’s shoulders he made a leap-frog
jump over the latter’s head and splashed loudly
into the water.</p>

<p>“Well,” said David, changing his position from
floating to treading water, “I think the coffee must
be boiling now. It’s time I dropped those eggs.”
And with leisurely strokes he made for the beach,
where he had thoughtfully left a Turkish towel beside
his pile of clothes.</p>

<p>The others followed suit, and had soon arrayed
themselves in the few garments they thought needful
to wear in their island home. David poured the
coffee and attended to the toast and eggs, which had
been procured the day before from a farmer on the
mainland. And as they ate, Ben propounded
the question:</p>

<p>“Fellows, what was it Christopher Cotterell said
about a mahogany man?”</p>

<p>“He said,” Tuckerman answered, “‘Find the
mahogany-hued man with the long, skinny legs and
look in his breast pocket.’”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Ben slowly. “Well, I’ve got an
idea I know where to find that man.”</p>

<p>The other three looked at him in utter amazement.
“The dickens you have, Benjie!” retorted
Tom. “Why, he couldn’t be alive now.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Ben thinks he’s a mummy,” suggested
David, “or a piece of wood that’s turned to stone.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I do,” Ben chuckled. “You’re getting
warm, old horse. Long, skinny legs—doesn’t that
remind you of something? Haven’t you seen any
that answer that description in this neighborhood?”</p>

<p>“You’re not referring to mine?” asked
Tuckerman.</p>

<p>The breakfast-party laughed, the Professor wore
such a look of injured dignity.</p>

<p>“No, sir, not to yours,” Ben said. “Yours are
fat as a drum compared to those I have in mind.”</p>

<p>“I remember Ben mumbled something about this
last night,” mused Tom. “But I was too sleepy
to listen. He said something about Sally Hooper,
too; something about her giving him an idea.”</p>

<p>Ben nodded. “So she did.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I always claim that our Benjie was a
real detective?” said David. “Clean up first; and
then for the yarn.”</p>

<p>Breakfast things were put away in their box, and
then the three turned to Ben. “Where’s your mahogany
man?” they demanded in one voice.</p>

<p>“There’s no hurry,” was the tantalizing answer.
“Perhaps I’d better go fishing first.”</p>

<p>Tom laid his hand on the other boy’s shoulder
and twisted him around. “Lead us to him,”
he commanded.</p>

<p>Ben shrugged. “Oh, very well. You’re more
interested than you were last night. Come along,
but don’t make any noise.”</p>

<p>He led them to Cotterell Hall. Tuckerman had
locked the front door after the girls had left on the
night before, and now he opened it with the key
he kept in his trouser pocket.</p>

<p>Ben led them into the hall, and then into the big
front room, which was now flooded with sunlight.</p>

<p>“Look around,” he announced; “and tell me
what you see.”</p>

<p>They looked about the room with puzzled faces.
“Rats!” exclaimed David. “I don’t see any
man here.”</p>

<p>Ben glanced at Tuckerman. “Long, skinny,
mahogany-colored legs,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Not Sir Peter’s portrait?” said Tuckerman.</p>

<p>Ben walked across the room in the direction of
the secretary. “When Sally came in here last night,”
he explained, “she said something about this desk.
‘Mahogany, I suppose—and what long, fluted, shiny
legs.’ Well, it has, hasn’t it?” He laid his hand
on the secretary. “Mightn’t this be the man?”</p>

<p>“You’re joking,” Tom protested; while David
looked from the desk to his friend’s serious face as
if he thought Ben must be plain crazy.</p>

<p>Tuckerman, however, laid his hand also on the
piece of furniture. “They liked their little joke in
the old days,” he observed. “It might be, Ben. If
that’s so——” He turned the small brass key in the
lock of the lid, and pulling out the two supports on
either side of the lower drawers let the lid down on
them. “If that’s so; and this is the mahogany
man—where’s his breast pocket?”</p>

<p>There were small drawers inside, and a row of
pigeonholes to either side of a central compartment
that was also locked by a key.</p>

<p>“Somewhere up in his chest,” said Ben.</p>

<p>Tuckerman pulled out the drawers and emptied
their contents, small objects, keys, pencils, bits of
sealing-wax, a few sheets of blank paper. He put
his hand in the pigeonholes and drew out several
bundles of letters. “I’ve been through all these
things before,” he said with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>“That place in the middle,” Tom suggested.</p>

<p>“Only an ink-stand,” said Tuckerman; and
unlocking the little door he drew forth a big glass
inkstand with a brass top. That was all there was
in the little cupboard; all the contents of the upper
part of the secretary were arrayed on the lid.</p>

<p>“No go,” said David. “The man hasn’t anything
in his pocket to give us any clue.”</p>

<p>“I must say,” said Tom, “it does seem
ridiculous to me that anyone could have meant
that desk——”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard,” mumbled Ben, who was paying no
attention to what the others were saying, “that old
desks have secret compartments. My grandfather
has an old one that looks something like this. Let
me see——” He slipped his hand into the pigeonhole
on the right of the little door Tuckerman had
unlocked, and began to feel around. “I say! Here’s
something. It feels like a wooden spring.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman put his hand into the central compartment.
“Push on the spring,” he directed.</p>

<p>Ben pushed and Tuckerman at the same moment
pulled out the cupboard that had harbored the inkstand.
It was a box that fitted snugly into the centre
of the secretary.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a great stunt,” said Tom. “It
comes to pieces like a nest of drawers.”</p>

<p>The four, their heads close together, looked into
the space from which the cupboard had come.</p>

<p>All they saw was an unvarnished piece of pine
board, apparently the back of the desk.</p>

<p>“Looks like my grandfather’s,” said Ben. “Yes,
there’s a couple of holes.” And putting his forefinger
and thumb into two indentations in the wood at
the back, he wriggled his hand around and drew out
a small drawer.</p>

<p>“Empty!” he muttered, disappointed, holding
the drawer so that the others could see.</p>

<p>Again he put his hand into the opening and drew
out a second drawer that had been under the first one.
This also was empty.</p>

<p>“One more chance.” He pulled out the bottom
drawer. In this there was something. Holding it
upside down, a small roll of paper fell out on the
lid of the desk.</p>

<p>“A piece of parchment,” said Tuckerman, picking
up the roll. He opened it out, holding it taut in
his two hands.</p>

<p>All eyes focussed on the sheet, on which were
scrawled, in a faint purplish ink, these lines:</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>I took the box</p>
<p class='line0'>cliff where was</p>

<p class='line0'>and so I hid</p>
<p class='line0'>pocket in the</p>
<p class='line0'>are two big</p>
<p class='line0'>make a mark</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>Tuckerman read these words aloud, three times
over. Then he gave a grunt. “Well, that’s that.
And it’s not so very illuminating, is it?”</p>

<p>Ben took the parchment. “Somebody’s cut it
across. See, the right hand words are close to the
edge. How disgusting!”</p>

<p>David and Tom each handled the parchment,
which was finally laid on the desk-lid, with the inkstand
to keep it from curling up into its original
tight roll.</p>

<p>David stroked his chin, pretending to be lost in
thought. “Somebody took the box—to the cliff—but
they were—and so somebody hid the box—in
his pocket—there are two big—that make a mark.
I gather from that line about the pocket that the box
was pretty small.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t say he hid it in his pocket,” Ben
objected. “It might have been a pocket in the cliff
just as well.”</p>

<p>“Who do you suppose he was?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Why, Peter Cotterell, of course,” David answered
promptly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said Tuckerman.
“This handwriting doesn’t look like that of a man
who was used to holding the pen. See how he’s
gone over some of the letters several times, as if he
wasn’t precisely sure how he ought to form them.
Sir Peter was a well-educated gentleman. He must
have known how to use a quill.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he wanted to disguise his handwriting,”
David suggested.</p>

<p>“Why would he want to do that?” Ben retorted.
“Whoever wrote that meant to leave a record of
what he’d done with the box. There wouldn’t be
any sense in faking his handwriting—certainly not
if he intended to hide the parchment away in a secret
drawer of the desk.”</p>

<p>“What sense would there be in his cutting it in
two then?” Tom inquired.</p>

<p>Tuckerman, who was sitting on the arm of a
chair, threw back his head and laughed. “Here we
are arguing about something that happened ever so
long ago, and we haven’t the least idea why it happened
this way.” He turned to the portrait on the
wall and shook his finger at it. “You—or some of
your household—knew how to make first-class puzzles,
Sir Peter.” Then, as he swung around to the
three boys, he added:</p>

<p>“My guess is that there’s a pocket in a cliff somewhere
on this island, and that there is—or was—a
box hidden in it.”</p>

<p>“Find the cliff,” said Tom.</p>

<p>Ben shook his head. “There are dozens of
cliffs.”</p>

<p>“Well, you won’t find anything more in your
mahogany man’s breast pocket,” Tom answered.
“You can see for yourself it’s empty.”</p>

<p>“My idea is,” said David, “that we get the <span class='it'>Argo</span>
and sail round the island till we sight a likely-looking
cliff.”</p>

<p>“That appeals to me,” agreed Tuckerman, “and
Tom can give me another lesson in how to handle
a boat.”</p>

<p>The parchment was put in its drawer, the three
drawers replaced, the cupboard pushed back and
caught by its spring, and the desk-lid lifted
and locked.</p>

<p>“I’d a heap rather hunt for clues out of doors
on a day like this,” said David.</p>

<p>But Ben sat down on a divan. “I want to do a
little thinking, fellows. You go along without me.
Maybe I’ll go fishing for dinners off the rocks after
a while.”</p>

<p>They laughed at Ben; but he would not be dissuaded.
He wanted to do some thinking, and he
meant to. “Stubborn as a mule,” said Tom. “He
gets his mind set on a thing, and dynamite won’t
budge him.”</p>

<p>So the others went down to the sailboat; and
presently Ben, getting up from the divan, went out
and cut himself a stick of willow. He brought it
back and began to whittle shavings all over the hardwood
floor of Cotterell Hall. He had seen men down
on the Barmouth docks whittle shavings for hours,
and he had copied the habit. He found it a great
help when he wanted to think things out.</p>

<h1 id='t2260'>VI—THE CLIPPER SHIP</h1>

<p>Ben Sully was a boy who would rather work
out a puzzle than do almost anything else. He had a
tremendous amount of patience, which possibly explains
why he was such a successful fisherman, since
he could wait longer, dangling a piece of bait in the
water, than nine out of ten fishes could resist the
temptation to find out what the bait tasted like. Any
kind of a <span class='it'>puzzle</span>, from cut out sections of cardboard
that fitted together to make a picture all the way
to ingenious contraptions of metal links that didn’t
want to come apart, was a delight to Ben. He had
boxes and boxes of them stored away in a closet at
home. He had invented secret codes and cryptograms
by the score, and when he was only ten years
old had constructed a private language of twenty-five
words that he had taught to Tom and David and
which the three of them had used among themselves
to the great admiration and envy of all the rest of
their school.</p>

<p>Naturally then Ben felt that this <span class='it'>puzzle</span> of Peter
Cotterell’s treasure was right in his line, and the
finding of the half-sheet of parchment whetted his
appetite to discover more. He walked about the
room, whittling shavings right and left, he sat down
and kept on whittling, he stood up again, and since
by now the willow-stick had been whittled down
to almost nothing, he threw what was left
in the fireplace.</p>

<p>That done, he went to a bookcase and took down
from the shelf on top the old notebook that Tuckerman
had found in his uncle’s bedroom. He thumbed
the pages until he came to the place where Tuckerman
had inserted a slip of paper. Ben read the words at
the top of the page out loud. “Find the mahogany-hued
man with the long, skinny legs and look in his
breast pocket. That’s a saying my father handed
down. What can it mean?” Ben looked at the desk.
“Well, we’ve done that, anyhow.” He shook his
head in deep thought. “I don’t understand why that
piece of parchment wasn’t discovered before. They
might not have taken the desk to be the mahogany
man; but surely Crusty Christopher or his father
would have known of those three little drawers.
However, they might have found that writing and
left it there. That’s possible, of course. Probably
it didn’t tell them any more than it’s told us so far.”</p>

<p>Turning again to the notebook, he ran his eye
down the page. Nothing but Christopher Cotterell’s
comments on all sorts of subjects, nothing that interested
Ben. He turned a page, two pages, another,
and then his glance fell on this: “I’ve heard that the
old clipper ship got some of the cargo that the mahogany
man carried. But if she did, what use is that
to us now? She sailed out of Barmouth Harbor
during the Revolution.”</p>

<p>On and on down the page Ben’s eyes traveled,
but lighted on nothing that caught his special attention.
So he went back and reread that passage. Then
he closed the book, replaced it on the shelf, stuck his
hands in his pockets, and stared through the window.</p>

<p>“I wonder if there was a real mahogany man,”
he mused, “and a real ship. There might have been.
There were men from the West Indies in this part
of the country in those days. One of them might
have had valuables in his clothes, and part of the
things he was guarding might have been carried off
in the hold of a ship. Was there a real man, or was
it that secretary? And how about the ship?”</p>

<p>Presently Ben walked around the drawing-room,
as if he were searching for something. From there
he went to the dining-room and the kitchen, and then
upstairs to Christopher Cotterell’s bedroom. He
looked into closets and behind curtains, he pulled open
wardrobe doors and peered in at the shelves. But
each time he shook his head, as much as to say:
“There’s nothing there that I want.”</p>

<p>Under the slanting roof at the top of the house
was an attic, already explored by Tuckerman and the
boys. It was filled with every kind of thing, from an
ancient lacquered Indian temple—the green and gold
of the lacquer now sadly tarnished and chipped—to
a collection of Red Men’s arrowheads, neatly fastened
to a board by small straps of leather. Ben
looked around at the strange medley of objects,
thinking how many countries and how many different
races of men had contributed to the furnishing of
this attic; and then his roving eyes lighted on something
that made them glisten—on a bracket against
the wall sat the model of a ship.</p>

<p>Ben knew the model to be that of a Yankee clipper—three
masts, loftily rigged, with three sky-sail
yards, and a long mainyard. She was beautifully
built, every detail complete, the deck and hull shining
with varnish. “Hello,” sang out Ben, “clipper ship
ahoy!” And pushing a box close against the wall
he stepped up opposite the bracket.</p>

<p>In the deck of the model was a little lid. He
pried this up with his knife-blade. There was just
room for him to squeeze his fingers through, and
when he drew them out again they held a small roll
of paper.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ben, “it’s parchment,” and very
much thrilled he took his find over to the window
and smoothed it out.</p>

<p>The ink on this parchment was faint and purplish,
like that on the sheet already found in the desk, and
the left hand words were close to the edge. Ben
read them aloud:</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>to the north</p>
<p class='line0'>the boat</p>
<p class='line0'>cape with it</p>
<p class='line0'>off the shore</p>
<p class='line0'>it in the</p>
<p class='line0'>rocks. There</p>
<p class='line0'>veins that</p>
<p class='line0'>like a cross.</p>
<p class='line0'>James Sampson.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>“Good enough!” said Ben, and ran down the
stairs to the first floor.</p>

<p>The little drawer in the secretary was again made
to disgorge its half-sheet of parchment and Ben laid
the two papers side by side on the desk-lid. They
fitted perfectly; now their message was complete.</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>I took the box to the north</p>
<p class='line0'>cliff where was the boat</p>
<p class='line0'>meaning to escape with it</p>
<p class='line0'>but they were off the shore</p>
<p class='line0'>and so I hid it in the</p>
<p class='line0'>pocket in the rocks. There</p>
<p class='line0'>are two big veins that</p>
<p class='line0'>make a mark like a cross.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;'>James Sampson.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>“Well, that’s clear enough,” said Ben, “though
why anyone should cut James Sampson’s writing in
two is more than I can understand.” He copied the
words on a sheet of paper and put the two pieces of
parchment in the secret drawer. “Now let’s see
what we’ve got. Sampson meant to leave the island
with his box at the northern end, but he saw some
enemies waiting there, so he hid the box in a crevice
where the rocks are marked like a cross. All right
for Mr. Sampson. That’s easy sailing. But why
didn’t some of the Cotterells find what was in the
hold of that little ship’s model long before this?
Funny—that is.” Again his brows bent in thought.
“Was James Sampson the real mahogany man?
Was there a real clipper ship?” At last he shook
his head. “I don’t know. But at least I’ve
found something.”</p>

<p>Ben left the house. It was noon, and warm. The
others were sailing around the island; there was no
knowing when they would be back. He debated
whether to go fishing, and finally decided against it.
Without any definite purpose in mind he took the
path at the back of Cotterell Hall that led toward
the little creek.</p>

<p>It was only a short distance across to the inlet
where David and he had landed. He went through
the bushes and trees until he saw the water before
him. There was the creek and there was the marshy
ground where they had found the footprints. He
descended the bank to look at the marks again.</p>

<p>There were no footprints there now: they had
utterly vanished!</p>

<p>Ben hunted along the edge of the creek, although
he was positive where the marks had been. There
was not a sign of them. There had been no rain to
wash them out. The soggy ground was above the
reach of the tide. There was only one explanation:
someone had been there since David and he
had landed and had carefully removed any sign
of footsteps.</p>

<p>To discover footprints on a supposedly uninhabited
shore is thrilling, but to discover that those
footprints have disappeared is even more exciting.
What did it mean? Well, to Ben it clearly indicated
that the person who had made those marks in the
first place had some very good reason for wanting no
one to know that he had been there.</p>

<p>Cotterell’s treasure was an ancient mystery; but
this was a new one, no older in fact than the day
before yesterday. This was new matter over which
to cudgel one’s brains, and Ben, sitting on the bank,
gave deep consideration to it until he saw the sail of
the <span class='it'>Argo</span> creeping up from the south.</p>

<p>Should he tell the others of his discoveries or not?
He decided to keep them a secret, including the vanished
footprints, for a short time at least. But he
jumped up, and ran down to the shore, and sent an
ear-piercing yell across the water. The answer was
a wave from Tom, and presently the <span class='it'>Argo</span> drew
closer inland and laid her course for a small, grass-topped
headland on Ben’s side of the creek.</p>

<p>“Don’t jump; slide down, Benjie, slide,” directed
Tom.</p>

<p>“And slide gently,” added David. “Not as if
you were making for third base with the ball getting
there before you. Remember the Professor’s at the
helm and we don’t want to tilt the boat.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry,” sang out Ben. “I’ll drop
in so you’ll think I’m as light as a feather.” And
as the <span class='it'>Argo</span> slipped along under the headland he let
himself down, lightly and easily, but, as it happened,
right on the shoulders of David.</p>

<p>The big fellow gave a growl. Ben’s legs had
somehow contrived to twine themselves around
David’s neck, and Ben was sitting there on the broad
shoulders, his hands on the other boy’s head.</p>

<p>“Hi there! Look out!” cried Tuckerman.
“You’ll upset the whole shebang!”</p>

<p>But Tom came to the skipper’s rescue. A steadying
hand on the tiller and the <span class='it'>Argo</span> moved out from
the shore.</p>

<p>Slowly Ben pushed David forward until they
both came down in a heap in the little cockpit. “Behave
yourselves,” ordered Tom. “I’ve got a dipper
here and I’ll souse you both with cold water!”</p>

<p>The threat was enough. The two sat up. David
grinned. “The little feller’s all right; he’s got some
muscle. I shouldn’t wonder if I could make a real
man out of him some day.”</p>

<p>Under Tom’s teaching John Tuckerman was
learning something about handling a sailing dory,
just as Ben had given him lessons in flounder fishing,
David in making flapjacks, and the three in various
swimming strokes. It was true that he still regarded
the <span class='it'>Argo’s</span> sail, when a sudden puff of wind filled it,
as an inexperienced driver regards his horse when
the animal shows signs of shying—his muscles grew
tense, and he frowned, and stopped talking—but he
didn’t ask Tom what to do and he managed to keep
the dory fairly close to the course he intended. And
he was a good sport! He didn’t try to crawl out of
his mistakes by arguing about them; he admitted
them with a grin, and that grin was always so whole-souled
and hearty that it made one want to slap him
on the back and tell him that he hadn’t really made
a mistake after all.</p>

<p>When Tuckerman had the <span class='it'>Argo</span> well in hand
again and could think of other matters, he said to
Ben, “We’ve seen plenty of rocks and ledges, but
nary a thing that could properly be called a cliff. A
cliff, I take it, is something fairly high and mighty,
not so steep as Gibraltar perhaps, but as large as a
good-sized barn-door.”</p>

<p>“While we’ve been hunting for cliffs,” said
David, “I suppose Ben has worked this all out.
What are your conclusions, oh wise one?”</p>

<p>“Never you mind, my boy. The clever magician
waits till he has everything in order before he performs
his trick.”</p>

<p>“Ben’s got something up his sleeve,” put in Tom.
“I can always tell when he talks in that grand way.
But there’s no use trying to make him tell us, Dave.
The way to make an oyster talk is to pay no attention
to it.”</p>

<p>Ben said nothing, though the temptation was
great as the <span class='it'>Argo</span> reached the northern end of the
island, where high rocks came down to the water.</p>

<p>Tuckerman admitted these were cliffs, but there were
a number of them, and how was he to tell which was
the one they wanted? They sailed slowly along,
watching the shore and speculating as to what the
message in the desk referred. And while the other
three talked Ben sat silent, trying to picture what had
happened to James Sampson there more than a
century before.</p>

<p>Ben had a good imagination, and it led him to
see Sampson as a servant of Sir Peter Cotterell, a
faithful serving-man, who always did what his master
told him. When the men of Barmouth threatened
to take Sir Peter’s treasure the old Tory gave some
of his most valuable possessions to Sampson, and
the latter carried them to this end of the island
where he had a small boat that should carry him to
the mainland. When he reached the shore, however,
he saw other Barmouth men patrolling the coast in
their own boats and so his escape that way was cut
off. With quick wit he hid the treasures in a cleft
of the rock and blocked up the hiding-place. Ben
could see it all, even to Sir Peter, in knee-breeches and
wig, commending James Sampson when the man
returned and related what he had done. “Good and
faithful servant,” said Sir Peter; “the rascals are
outwitted again!” And doubtless Sir Peter took
Sampson into the dining-room and poured him out a
glass of rum. Ben wasn’t sure about that; it might
not have been rum; but rum sounded well, it smacked
of old-time adventure. Yes, probably it was rum;
and Sampson had wiped his mouth with the sleeve
of his jacket and laughed with his master at the
thought of the men of Barmouth sitting out there in
their boats, like so many cats waiting outside a
mouse-hole.</p>

<p>“Come out of it, Ben! Wake up!”</p>

<p>Ben looked up with a start. Tom was laughing
at him. “Where are you, Benjie? A million
miles away!”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Ben, “I was listening to Sir
Peter talking to a man you don’t any of you know
anything about.”</p>

<p>“Your precious mahogany man?” asked Tom.
“Don’t tell me you learned something more about
him while you were up at the house.”</p>

<p>“He means the man with the big feet,” said
David. “Did you find his prints in the house?”</p>

<p>“David,” said Ben solemnly, “you’re absolutely
certain you saw those footprints of a man on the
bank of the creek, are you?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely,” David stated. “You don’t think
it was some animal wearing a man’s shoes, do you?”</p>

<p>“No. I thought you saw them. But I looked
this morning in the same place, and there aren’t any
prints there now.”</p>

<p>There followed a moment’s silence; then
Tuckerman exploded a loud “What?”</p>

<p>“Vanished, vamoosed, flown away,” Ben said
with a nod.</p>

<p>“My eye!” exclaimed David. “This is too horrible!
Is the island haunted?”</p>

<p>“It is peculiar,” said Tuckerman, frowning at
the shore.</p>

<p>“Look out!” sang out Tom.</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Argo</span>, her helmsman unheeding his business,
was slowly coming about, with a ledge of rock dead
ahead. Tuckerman wheeled around, put the tiller
over—the dory righted again.</p>

<p>“Ben,” said Tom, “don’t you spring anything
like that on us again, with the Professor sailing this
boat. If you’ve got any other fairy tales, you keep
them till we’re on shore.”</p>

<p>“My fault,” said the skipper. “I’m learning.
My first business is to bring us safe up to the dock.”</p>

<p>“And my first business,” added David, “is to get
something to eat. Mysteries may come and go, but
three square meals a day are always needful. How
about that, Ben, my son? What did Sir Peter and
this other friend of yours live on?”</p>

<p>“Rum,” said the solemn Ben.</p>

<p>“Rum! You’re a rum one! Are you sure you
didn’t drink some of Sir Peter’s rum before
you went to the creek and found that the footprints
were missing?”</p>

<p>But Ben only smiled. He could afford to smile
when he knew that he, and he alone, had a copy of
James Sampson’s complete message tucked away in
his pocket.</p>

<h1 id='t2673'>VII—THE TIGERS PLAY CAMP AMOUSSOCK</h1>

<p>Needless to say, Ben would have liked to start
out immediately after dinner to look for the pocket
in the rocks that was marked with a cross, provided
he could have found a good excuse to get away from
the others; for he was still of a mind to keep his
discovery a secret for the present. But the larder
was in need of fresh supplies, and as soon as they
had finished their cleaning up Tom announced that
their immediate business was to sail across to Farmer
Hapgood’s and buy some eggs and milk. So the
<span class='it'>Argo</span> put out into the bay again, and soon the four
campers, the sailboat safely moored at the Hapgood
landing, were tramping up the road toward a gray-shingled
cottage that had a couple of beautiful, tall
elms at either side of it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hapgood sold them eggs, milk, and butter,
and some large loaves of freshly-baked bread. These
were packed in a basket the boys had brought. When
they came out from the house they stopped a few
moments to chat with Mrs. Hapgood, and while they
were talking two large automobiles swung in from a
crossroad and raced past the farmhouse door.</p>

<p>The two cars were filled with boys, boys on the
seats and on the running-boards. “They’re from
Camp Amoussock, down along the shore a way,”
Mrs. Hapgood explained. “They’re going to have
a baseball game with the boys around here. My
Sandy’s playing. He’s getting into his things upstairs
now, but he’ll be down in a minute.”</p>

<p>The cars disappeared in a cloud of dust, and
almost immediately a red-haired, freckle-faced young
fellow, in a baseball suit, dashed out from the
front door.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he cried, nodding to the others. “That
crowd made as much noise with their horns as if
they’d won the game already.”</p>

<p>“Pretty good team, are they?” asked David.</p>

<p>“Yes, they’re a good team,” said Sandy; “but
mighty stuck on themselves. They come from a lot
of different cities, and most of them play on their
school nines. They’ve beaten us the last two summers.
Gee, but we’d like to get back at ’em to-day!”</p>

<p>“Who’s on your team?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, we call ourselves the Tidewater Tigers.
Most of us live around here. One, Billy Burns,
comes from Barmouth. Native sons of New
Hampshire against the strangers—that’s what my
father says.”</p>

<p>“We know Billy Burns,” said Ben. “He’s a
good batter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s good,” agreed Sandy. “But they’ve
got a pitcher who’s a corker. Lanky Larry they call
him. He’s the goods all right—lots of speed and a
curve. I’ll say he is! Fanned me three times last
year.” Sandy clutched his bat. “Gee, but I’d like
to sting him!”</p>

<p>“Let’s feel it,” said David. He took the bat
and swung it several times. “A little light, but not
bad,” he pronounced judicially.</p>

<p>“Say, why don’t you all come along? We’ll
show you some real excitement. You can leave that
basket here.”</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other, and suddenly
Tuckerman burst out laughing. “Lead us to it,
Sandy. I can see these three have got their tongues
hanging out.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said David slowly, “I do hate to pass a
good thing by.”</p>

<p>“He wants a sight of this Lanky Larry,” said
Tom. “A good pitcher to Dave is like a red rag
to a bull.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hapgood relieved Tom of the basket.
“You boys are native sons,” she said with a smile.
“Go along and root for the Tigers.”</p>

<p>Up the road they went until they came to an open
field marked out with a baseball diamond. The two
automobiles were parked on one side, and on the
other was a crowd of boys and girls, interspersed
with a few older people. Already some of the Tigers
and some of the Amoussocks were knocking out flies
to their fielders.</p>

<p>“There’s Lanky, warming up,” said Sandy,
pointing to a tall, dark-skinned fellow who was
throwing a ball to a catcher in front of the automobiles.
“They’re a swell lot, aren’t they? They’ve
all got brand new suits this summer, with red and
white stockings, and a red A on their chests.”</p>

<p>The Amoussocks did look very trim; more especially
in contrast to the native sons, who were
dressed in all sorts of suits, the most of them old
and mud-stained.</p>

<p>“Here’s Billy Burns,” said Sandy; and as
Tuckerman and the three boys went up to join the
crowd, Sandy darted away to report himself to
his captain.</p>

<p>Billy came up. “Hi, you fellows. What you
doing here?”</p>

<p>“Digging clams for bait,” answered David.
“Benjie wants to go fishing.”</p>

<p>“Come down to see us smear the strangers?”
Billy continued, ignoring David’s joke.</p>

<p>“I hear that Lanky Larry’s a terror.” This
from Tom.</p>

<p>“Terror’s the word,” Billy admitted. “Say,
Dave, you think you’re some hitter in Barmouth.
But you’ve never stacked up against his class.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said David. “I’ve sent
some good men to the discard. Howsomever, it’s
not up to me this afternoon to tackle the strangers.
I’m neutral to-day.”</p>

<p>“Go to it, Billy!” said Ben. “We’re going to
root for you. Of course we are. We’re not pikers.”</p>

<p>It was clear that this was a big day in the eyes
of the community. A hay-wagon rattled up, loaded
with empty boxes and a pile of boards. The boxes
were stood on end on the ground and the planks
placed across them, and the seats thus made were
instantly filled by boys and girls. On the opposite
side waved a large banner, white with a gigantic
red A in the centre. There were shouts and cheers
from both sides as the two teams gathered round
the umpire; then the Tigers ran out to take the field
and the first Amoussock batter stepped up to
the plate.</p>

<p>The campers from Cotterell’s Island sat on the
grass with the New Hampshire boys. Half the fun
of watching any contest is in rooting for one side to
win, and naturally the campers were backing the
home nine. The Amoussocks had a superior air,
partly due perhaps to their snappy suits and partly
to the fact that they had beaten the Tigers each of
the two summers before. And they knew how to
play baseball; there was a snap and precision about
their work that was the result of constant coaching
in teamwork.</p>

<p>Against them the home team, mostly the sons of
neighboring farmers, boys who had to coach themselves
and only played together on Saturdays, showed
at a decided disadvantage. They had plenty of fighting
spirit and kept right up on their toes, playing
for all they were worth, taking big chances in stealing
bases and backing each other up on every throw.
But they couldn’t hit Lanky Larry—not to any
extent; and the Amoussocks could, and did, hit Sam
Noyes, the Tiger pitcher.</p>

<p>David shook his head as the third inning ended.
“That Lanky’s got ’em where he wants ’em,” he
said. “He eases up a bit, and lets us get a hit or
two; but watch him in the pinches. He can tighten
up and shoot ’em over. Yes, siree,—nothing he likes
better than a couple of them on the bases, and then
putting over three strikes, simple as you please.”</p>

<p>Tom took a blade of grass from his mouth.
“And he keeps grinning. Nothing riles a batter
worse than that sort of a pitcher. ‘See how simple
it is,’ he says with that smile. ‘Like taking candy
from a kid to get a strike on you’—and he goes
ahead and shoots one over while you’re planning how
you’ll wipe the grin from his face.”</p>

<p>Billy Burns dropped down beside them. “Two
to nothing,” he declared. “Sam’s doing mighty
well, but Lanky’s doing better. It’s that in-shoot
of his. I know just where it’s going, but hang it
all! every blessed time I reach right out for it.”</p>

<p>“He’s got your goat,” said David. “You’re
so all-fired mad that you don’t wait for the ball to
get near you.”</p>

<p>“Huh, it’s easy to talk! I suppose you could
wait all day.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t get tied up tight, stiff as a
stick. That’s the trouble with all our team. They’re
so keen to hit they can’t wait. Larry’s got them
going before they walk out there; and he knows
it too, believe me!”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’d be as cool as a cucumber,”
Billy jeered.</p>

<p>“As fat as a cucumber, you mean,” suggested
Ben. “When Dave leans against the ball it’s like a
ton of bricks.”</p>

<p>“We’re out again,” announced Billy, picking up
his fielder’s glove. “We’re not so worse in the
field; but golly, if we could only hit!”</p>

<p>The Tigers couldn’t hit, however. The crowd
on the benches rooted as hard as they could, but the
native sons stayed behind. And the visitors grew
more dashing. They kept talking to each other on
the bases, little remarks filled with self-esteem; it
was easy to see they were very well pleased
with themselves.</p>

<p>David kept pulling blades of grass, chewing them,
spitting them out. Every time that a Tiger came
to bat David felt as if it were he himself who was
facing that smiling pitcher.</p>

<p>The fifth inning came and went; the score was
still the same. Billy Burns, in spite of what David
had told him, had struck out again.</p>

<p>Tom stood up and stretched. “No, boys, it isn’t
our day—unless something different happens. I
guess that old New Hampshire’s got to take the
short end.”</p>

<p>Something did happen; but not what Tom expected.
Billy Burns, in the outfield, running after
a deep fly to centre, made a dive for the ball at full
speed, stumbled, fell headlong, but held up the ball
in his hand.</p>

<p>“Batter’s out!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>The loyal rooters cheered. Billy, however, lay
flat, and when, after a moment, he tried to get up,
he sat down quickly again.</p>

<p>The other fielders ran over to him and stood him
up between them. Billy held up one foot, put it
down, gave a groan. “Twisted my ankle, I guess,”
he muttered. He tried to take a step forward. “No
go,” he added. “Hang it all, just my luck!”</p>

<p>Two fielders brought him in between them, Billy
hopping on one foot. The Tigers held a consultation,
while the Amoussocks threw the ball around.
Then Sam Noyes, the Tiger captain, stepped over
to David. “Billy’s down and out,” he said. “He
can’t play any more. But he says you think you can
hit their pitcher; and you’re from Barmouth, so
that’d be all right. Want to take Billy’s place?”</p>

<p>David glanced up. He knew by the look on
Sam’s face that the Tiger captain didn’t believe he
could bat any better than the others. “All right,”
he answered. “I didn’t mean to boast, you know;
but I’ll do my darndest.”</p>

<p>“No one can do more,” murmured Tuckerman
behind him.</p>

<p>David peeled off his coat and put on Billy’s glove.
He lumbered out to centrefield while Sam Noyes
explained the substitution to the Amoussock captain.</p>

<p>In the last half of the sixth inning David came
to bat. Lanky Larry patted the ball caressingly,
surveyed the new player from head to foot, and then
grinned as if he had suddenly remembered a tremendous
joke. David dug his feet into the earth of
the batter’s box, wishing he had on the cleated shoes
he wore when he played on his school team, swung
his bat—one he had carefully selected from the
varied assortment offered by the Tigers—and then
grinned as if he also had thought of something
very funny.</p>

<p>“I say, what’s the joke, you two fellows?” sang
out a man who was standing back of the benches.</p>

<p>That made everybody laugh, with the result that
Lanky, when he pitched the ball, threw it wide and
missed the plate by a couple of inches.</p>

<p>“Ball one!” proclaimed the umpire.</p>

<p>“Make it be good!” yelled Ben.</p>

<p>David hitched up his trousers and lifted his bat
again. Lanky patted the ball and smiled, but not
so broadly. He shot the next one across the plate
with speed and precision, David letting it go by
without swinging at it.</p>

<p>“Strike one!” sang the umpire.</p>

<p>“You’ve got him, Lanky!” came a voice from
the ranks of the Amoussocks.</p>

<p>“Oh dear!” sighed a girl on the Tiger’s bench,
loud enough to be heard across the diamond; “I
thought this fellow looked like he could knock a
home run!”</p>

<p>There was a titter, a ripple of laughter, and
Larry, fondling the ball, looked over in the direction
of the girl and grinned from ear to ear.</p>

<p>The ball shot from his hand. There was a crack—sharp
and stinging;—Larry reached out, missed
the ball as it whizzed by—whizzed on over the bag
at second base, sizzled on into the outfield. Centrefield
couldn’t touch it; that ball simply wouldn’t stop,
and didn’t until it struck a stone wall at the end
of the field.</p>

<p>By the time the ball got back David was standing
on third base, and the Tiger rooters were splitting
the air with yells.</p>

<p>“Dave leaned against it all right, didn’t he?”
said Ben to Tuckerman. “He came around on it
just as easy; but when he struck he made every
ounce tell.”</p>

<p>“He’d have had a home run if it hadn’t been
for that stone wall,” said Tuckerman. “The field’s
too short; it doesn’t give our Dave a show.”</p>

<p>Lanky Larry looked less amused. He frowned
and grew thoughtful; with the result that the next
Tiger up got a neat hit to right field, and David
came trotting home.</p>

<p>But the inning ended on the next play, the Tiger
being caught out at second base. The score was two
to one, in the Amoussock’s favor. The crowd felt
somewhat better as the Tigers took the field again.
The Amoussocks, however, managed to get in another
run at their turn at bat, and had a good
lead of two.</p>

<p>The seventh and eighth innings repeated the same
old story. Lanky was in form again, and none of
the batters could hit him. And with the score at
three to one the Amoussocks prepared to mow down
their rivals in the last half of the ninth.</p>

<p>David was to be the third batter, and he swung
two bats over his shoulder as he waited for his turn.
Lanky knew what he was doing, was in fact watching
him out of the corner of his eye, and looking forward
to his next chance at the cocky David. Thinking
what he would do to David he forgot the job in hand,
and struck Sam Noyes on the arm. The umpire sent
Sam to first. Larry scowled and bit his lip. The
next Tiger got a hit, and Sam went to second.</p>

<p>The crowd jumped to its feet, both sides were
rooting madly. “If only there was room for a home
run!” sighed Ben. “Old Barmouth could do it!
Keep cool, Dave my lad!”</p>

<p>David was perfectly cool, to all appearance at
least, as he walked up to the plate. He smiled
and gave the least little nod at the tall, dark-skinned
pitcher.</p>

<p>A duel between these two;—that was what the
crowd felt in the air. The fielders were hopping
about, crouching, their hands on their knees; Sam
and the Tiger on first base were flapping their arms,
all ready to dash for the next base. But nobody
looked at them; all eyes were on the two who were
regarding each other with pleasant smiles.</p>

<p>“Strike one!”</p>

<p>David stepped back, a bit surprised, while the
crowd gave a groan.</p>

<p>“Ball one!” There was a little ripple of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“But he’s got to hit it,” Tom muttered in
Tuckerman’s ear. “A base on balls won’t do. The
next fellow’d go out.”</p>

<p>And David knew he’d got to hit it, and kept
telling himself not to tighten up. “Easy does it,
easy does it,” kept singing over and over in his mind.
If he tried too hard Lanky would get him just as he
had gotten the others; and he knew perfectly well
that was what Lanky intended that he should do.</p>

<p>“Strike two!”</p>

<p>Larry had outguessed him that time, giving him
a slow drop. David eased his muscles, smiled his
confident smile, settled evenly on his feet. This next
would be the in-shoot. Larry would save that for
the last. “Easy does it; take your time.” David
looked at the pitcher, not angrily, not intently, just
with a jovial dare.</p>

<p>And the bat, with David’s shoulders behind it,
and his waist and his legs as well, met that ball as it
curved in toward him fair and square on the nose.
There was a mighty crack—the sort that sings in the
ears and makes the pulses tingle—and away and
away went the ball. Over the pitcher’s head, over
the heads of the fielders; far out in the field it struck
the ground at last and bounded over the stone wall.
It brought up against a cow, that was lying down in
a meadow, and it gave her such a bump that she rose
in haste and went galloping away, not knowing what
had struck her. And by the time the first Amoussock
outfielder touched that ball Sam Noyes and the next
Tiger and David had circled the bases and the game
was won.</p>

<p>Billy Burns hopped over to David, forgetful of
his sprained ankle. “Put it there, old scout!” he
cried, holding out his hand. “I never saw such a
hit! Gee whillikins! Dave, you’re the stuff
all right!”</p>

<p>“Easy does it,” said David, who couldn’t think
of anything else to say.</p>

<p>“Easy!” exclaimed Billy. “You call that easy!
I’d like to know what you do to a ball when you hit
it hard!”</p>

<h1 id='t3128'>VIII—THE CANOE</h1>

<p>David would have liked to have taken to his heels
and beaten it down the road to the bay, but he was
not allowed to do this. Not only the Tigers, but
all that section of New Hampshire appeared to think
that he had vindicated the honor of the country
against the big cities, represented in this case by the
boys of Camp Amoussock. Horny-handed farmers
insisted on coming up and shaking his hand, slapping
him on the back, inviting him to supper. And what
tickled Ben more than anything else was to see the
girl who had exclaimed, “I thought this fellow
looked like he could knock a home run!” push her
way through the crowd and thrust out her hand
at David.</p>

<p>Ben nudged Tom. “Look at our brave boy now.”</p>

<p>The girl was saying, “I knew you looked like
a winner. I’ve got a kid brother at home; he’s got
a sore foot and couldn’t get over here; but I’m going
to tell him how you soaked that ball and hit the old
cow, and maybe he won’t be excited! What’s your
name? He’ll want to know.”</p>

<p>No beet was ever redder than David’s face as
he gave a sheepish grin. “David Norton,” he said.
And as the girl insisted on shaking hands he touched
her fingers gingerly. “Much obliged,” he stammered.
“Hope the kid’s foot gets well again. Funny
about that cow;—hope it didn’t hurt her.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t care,” said the girl, “if it broke one
of her ribs. But don’t you worry, Mr. Norton.
I’m right glad to have met you.” And she pushed
her way out of the throng again, delighted to be able
to tell her kid brother that she had shaken hands
with the hero of the day.</p>

<p>“You may be a mighty batter,” said Ben, when
David was able at last to rejoin his friends, “but
when it comes to the girls you’re a beautiful imitation
of a wooden Indian. You shake hands like a pump.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out,” growled David, who always
stood more or less in fear of girls, and hated to be
teased about them. “I suppose you’d have made
her some kind of a pretty speech; asked her to
dance, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“I’d have looked as if I liked being told how
fine I was. Oh, what a shame it is that nobody
ever says such things to me,” sighed Ben, “when
I’m the one that could really appreciate them!”</p>

<p>Sandy Hapgood now came up, and David, eager
to be rid of any more talk about the game, hurried
his friends away. “Looks like a thunderstorm,”
he said, squinting at the sky, where dark clouds were
rapidly rising.</p>

<p>They passed the meadow, where the cow was now
peacefully chewing her cud again. She cast a reproachful
eye at the boy in the baseball suit. “That’s
the longest hit that was ever made on our field,”
remarked Sandy. “And against Lanky Larry, too!
Oh boy! Did you see Lanky after the game? He
looked—well, he didn’t look so all-fired stuck
on himself.”</p>

<p>“He’s a fine pitcher,” said David; “a mighty
good one.”</p>

<p>They quickened their steps, for big drops of rain
were beginning to fall. They turned in at the
Hapgood farmhouse and stopped long enough for a
word with Sandy’s mother. Tom swung the basket
of provisions on his arm.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you’d better wait a short spell,”
said Mrs. Hapgood. “Looks to me as if we were
in for a right smart shower.”</p>

<p>They looked at the sky—pierced now with frequent
sharp jabs of lightning.</p>

<p>“It’s not raining hard yet,” said Tuckerman.
“How about it, boys?”</p>

<p>“Let’s beat it,” said Tom.</p>

<p>Out in the road again they jogged down to the
water, where the <span class='it'>Argo</span> was fastened. Casting her
adrift, Tom took the tiller.</p>

<p>It was a real summer thunderstorm that had come
up quickly—spurts of rain and banks of black clouds—at
the end of the warm day.</p>

<p>But the boys were used to a wetting, and Tom
had often sailed through a heavier downpour than
this. David stretched himself out on a seat in luxurious
comfort. “A shower-bath feels good,” he
murmured. “All I want now is a good swim.”</p>

<p>The wind, however, wouldn’t stay in any one
quarter; it kept jumping about as if it were trying
to box the compass and succeeding pretty well. Tom
had to keep changing course. The <span class='it'>Argo</span> zigzagged
about like a darning-needle flying over a pond. And
the thunder kept crashing louder, and the lightning
opening bigger and bigger cracks in the violet-black
of the sky.</p>

<p>“Hello, there’s a canoe!” sang out Ben suddenly.</p>

<p>Ahead of them, an eighth of a mile from shore,
a cockleshell craft was dancing over the waves.
There were two people in it, one at either end, and
each was paddling fast.</p>

<p>“Ticklish business,” said Tuckerman. “There’s
white water off that point. See how it jerks about.
I say, Tom, couldn’t we get up near them?”</p>

<p>“Righto,” answered the skipper. “Confound
those blooming gusts!”</p>

<p>If the <span class='it'>Argo</span> was having her hands full in
standing up to the constant squalls that kept chasing
over the water, the canoe was finding the struggle
an even more difficult task. She careened, righted,
almost disappeared in a wave. The <span class='it'>Argo’s</span> crew
were now all at the rail, except the skipper, watching
the little craft battle her way along.</p>

<p>Then Ben sang out: “Why, it’s Lanky
Larry and the Amoussock captain! Gee, but that
water’s rough!”</p>

<p>A lightning flash so vivid that it seemed to daze
the crews of both the boats, was followed by a roll
of thunder that shook the sea and the sky. Next
instant the waves leaped up as if in a frenzy of
fright. A great roller caught the canoe and twisted
her nose about; another slapped her amidships; a
third—All that the crew of the <span class='it'>Argo</span> saw was
a swirl of wild waters where the little craft had been.</p>

<p>Tuckerman muttered something. Tom, with a
shout of warning, brought the <span class='it'>Argo</span> about. Now
there were to be seen in the water two heads, two
tossing paddles, and the upturned bottom of
the canoe.</p>

<p>The point of land was not far distant, and for
some reason the boys in the water were striking out
in that direction, possibly because they thought the
sailboat, in such a squall, could not keep her course.</p>

<p>While Tom manoeuvred the <span class='it'>Argo</span>, the other three
watched the swimmers. Both were making fair
headway, the Amoussock captain somewhat in the
lead. Then suddenly Larry threw up his hands
and disappeared.</p>

<p>Tom swung the sailboat around, and almost instantly
Ben and David, coats and shoes stripped off,
dove into the water. For the moment the sea was
calmer, and the two made the most of their chance.
Hand over hand, in great spurts, they drew closer
and closer to the place where Larry had vanished.</p>

<p>Tom said things to the sail, which would not fill
as he wanted. Tuckerman clutched the rail, his eyes
never leaving the swimmers. And at last—an eternity,
it seemed to the watcher—the two boys reached
the spot. A moment later, and in some way they
had managed to draw Larry up between them.</p>

<p>By now the Amoussock captain had turned and
was swimming back; and by now Tom had contrived
to make the <span class='it'>Argo</span> behave. With a rush she arrived
where the boys were struggling in the waves. Ben
clutched at the side; with his other hand he helped
David lift Larry up into Tuckerman’s arms.</p>

<p>Larry was hauled aboard. David and Ben
climbed in. The other boy was pulled up from
the water.</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Argo</span>, restive, cavorting, commenced to
dance again. “Can’t stop to pick up the canoe,” muttered
Tom. “Thank Heaven, Lanky’s all right!”</p>

<p>Larry, very white and shivering, was rubbing
the muscles of his legs. “It was a cramp,” he explained.
“Doubled me up in a minute.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman put his coat around Larry’s shoulders.
“Never mind, never mind,” he kept murmuring.
“We’ll have you up at my house in a couple
of jiffies.”</p>

<p>And, the wind blowing great guns, but keeping
in a fairly steady direction, the <span class='it'>Argo</span> soon reached
the island. By that time Larry, assisted by
Tuckerman, had managed to rub the kinks out of
his leg muscles, and was able to hobble ashore.</p>

<p>Cold, and drenched, and all of them shivering
more or less, the party went up to the house. “The
kitchen’s the place,” said Tuckerman. “There’s
plenty of firewood there.”</p>

<p>Shortly the logs were blazing on the wide kitchen
hearth, and Tuckerman, finding a tin of coffee in a
cupboard, was making a steaming drink. Tom in
the meantime had brought an armful of Christopher
Cotterell’s clothes from a room abovestairs, and the
boys who had been in the water put on dry things.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Larry, when he was warm and
dry, and had swallowed half-a-cupful of Tuckerman’s
steaming hot coffee, “I knew this David fellow was
a good sport when I tried to strike him out this
afternoon; though I tell you it made me mad when
he stung that ball for a homer.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” said David. “A fellow’s
got to do his duty.”</p>

<p>“You do yours, all right,” nodded Larry. “I
guess we’ll have to forgive him now, won’t we, Bill?”</p>

<p>Bill Crawford, the Amoussock captain, gave his
knee a great slap. “We’ll have to elect him to the
club of good scouts, Lanky. And the rest of this
bunch, too.”</p>

<p>“Pass the coffee pot,” said David.</p>

<p>Stretched at his ease in a cane-bottomed kitchen
chair, Larry’s eyes roved around the room. “I
thought there wasn’t anybody on this island this summer,”
he said. “That’s the story they tell at
the camp.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, it’s deserted,” said Ben, “except for
Professor Tuckerman and his three able assistants.”</p>

<p>“What is the Professor doing here?” asked
Bill Crawford.</p>

<p>There was a momentary silence, broken by Ben’s
solemn voice. “He’s busy polishing up the knocker
of the big front door. I don’t know whether you
noticed it when you came in, but there is a beautiful
knocker, made of pure brass. He shines it
every day.”</p>

<p>An amused snicker from Bill was followed by
Larry’s asking another question.</p>

<p>“This is the Cotterell house, isn’t it? There’s
some old yarn about it, seems to me I’ve heard.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of an old house that
didn’t have some yarn attached to it?” demanded
Tuckerman.</p>

<p>“Change the subject, Lanky,” sang out Bill.
“’Tisn’t fair to pry into the family’s secrets.”</p>

<p>“Right you are.” Larry stretched his arms.
“Well, the question before us is how are we going
to get back to camp before they find that canoe, and
us missing?”</p>

<p>Tom went to the kitchen door and looked out.
“The storm isn’t over yet,” he announced. “Couldn’t
you lads stay to supper? If you will, I’ll sail you
back afterwards. Likely as not the water’ll be
smooth as a mill-pond in an hour or so.”</p>

<p>“They won’t be looking for you at your camp
yet,” said Tuckerman. “They’ll think you landed
somewhere, and are waiting for the squall to
blow over.”</p>

<p>“We’ll stay to supper,” said Bill. “It would be
a shame to have you fellows get wet again on
account of us.”</p>

<p>David jumped up. “We’ve got provisions
stowed away right here in the kitchen.” Rolling up
his sleeves, he gave directions to his assistant cooks.</p>

<p>The kitchen of Cotterell Hall had never seen as
much activity as it did in the next half hour, with the
result that a sumptuous feast was soon set out on
the table.</p>

<p>They ate as if they hadn’t tasted food for a
week, cleaned up, and trooped out to the front door.
The squall was over, a light wind was blowing—not
enough to ruffle the water—and stars were beginning
to shine in a cloudless sky.</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Argo’s</span> sail was raised, and the skipper sent
her across the bay to the place where the canoe had
upset. Search soon found the canoe rocking in the
surf on a sandy beach of the mainland. She was
righted and her painter fastened to a cleat at the
stern of the sailboat, and the <span class='it'>Argo</span> took a course
alongshore. Presently, rounding a point, the crew
saw a bonfire at Camp Amoussock lighting a stretch
of woods.</p>

<p>They all went ashore, and found the Camp just
about to start out on a search for the missing boys.
The visitors had to stay a while and be entertained
by their hosts, and it was not until the moon was
high in the sky that the <span class='it'>Argo</span> again pushed her nose
across the water, a southernly breeze filling her sail.</p>

<p>As they came abreast of the western end of their
island another sailboat, looking like a great white
moth in the moonlight, went scudding away over the
silver sea.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Ben, “what is she doing here?
Poaching on our preserves, it seems to me.”</p>

<p>“The harbor’s free to everyone,” said David.
“I don’t suppose even Crusty Christopher objected
to people sailing boats on the water, if they didn’t
try to land on his shore.”</p>

<p>“Lanky knew there was some old yarn about the
Cotterell house,” Ben continued, paying no attention
to David’s remark. “And if he knew, why
shouldn’t others?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tom, “what’s the answer?”</p>

<p>“The answer is that we’re likely to have callers.
Not the kind that leave their visiting-cards, but the
sort that snoop around when nobody’s home.”</p>

<p>“Thieves?” questioned David.</p>

<p>“No,” said Ben, “I didn’t mean thieves exactly.
Detectives come nearer to what I meant.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman chuckled. “Benjamin, you’re a
wonder! You never let go of an idea once you get
your teeth in it, do you? I’d forgotten all about the
treasure. I was studying the stars, and Dave was
thinking about baseball, and Tom about the course
he’s steering; but you—why, you were puzzling your
wits about Sir Peter and the mahogany man, and
goodness knows what else. Keep it up, Ben my boy.
That’s the road to success.”</p>

<p>And Ben, thinking of what he had found that
morning, grinned but said nothing. If he could only
work out the scheme he had in his mind, he felt
that he would be prouder than if he knocked home
runs against the very best baseball pitchers in the
major leagues.</p>

<h1 id='t3501'>IX—THE CHEST IN THE ROCKS</h1>

<p>John Tuckerman was leaning on his arm and
looking out at the sparkling, gleaming blue-green
water when Ben Sully woke next day. Ben kept
still and watched him, as he had watched him on
several other mornings. Tuckerman looked so
absorbed, so intent. He seemed to be sniffing the
air. And Ben, to whom a summer morning on the
New England coast presented no novelty, appreciated
that to this man everything about him seemed
like a part of wonderland.</p>

<p>The only sounds were the lapping of waves and
the calling of birds in the woods back of the camp.
A great gray-white gull was soaring far out over
the water, slanting first this way, then that, as though
he were trying his wings before he made a real flight.
Nearer shore two white terns circled round and
round, and then dropped straight in the bay, their
sharp beaks darting at fish. The shore of the mainland
rose in a green swell, on which pearl-colored
fleecy clouds seemed to be floating, and the shore
of the island itself, above the beach, was a tangle
of bay and juniper and wild roses, all shades of
greens and pinks in the early sun.</p>

<p>Ben saw this through Tuckerman’s eyes, and
felt the spell of enchantment. Then David rolled
over, stretched his arms, grunted; and the spell was
broken. A pine-cone, tossed by Ben, landed on
David’s nose. “Hi there, you mosquito!” exclaimed
the nose’s owner. He threw the pine-cone
at Tom. “Time to be up, lazybones. Breakfast
in half-an-hour, and those who aren’t down when
the bell rings won’t get any!”</p>

<p>“The tub’s mine first!” shouted John
Tuckerman, and pulling off his pajamas he took
a few leaps across the grass and raced over the sand
to the water, where he ducked under a wave and
bobbed up again, splashing and yelling.</p>

<p>Ben, then David, then Tom, followed, making
more noise between them than all the wildfowl on
the island put together. The water was cold, but
fine for a morning swim, and when, after fifteen
minutes, the four came out on the beach again, they
seized the Turkish towels that hung conveniently
on a juniper, and rubbed themselves to a brilliant
lobster-like glow.</p>

<p>“That particular swimming-pool,” said John
Tuckerman,—“I refer to the one commonly called
the damp spot, or the ocean,—beats all the porcelain-lined
tubs it has ever been my privilege to bathe in.
It’s true there’s only cold water; but come out into
this sun for a few minutes and you’ll be hot enough.
Now it seems to me”—but at that particular moment
he began to pull his flannel shirt over his head, and
when his words again became audible he was saying
“shake well, and take a teaspoonful in a glass of
water every morning before breakfast.”</p>

<p>Breakfast! Magic word after a swim in the
ocean! The boys jumped into their clothes and set
to work. For the next half-hour the thoughts of all
the campers were centred on food.</p>

<p>But as soon as his plate was cleared Ben began to
consider another matter. He quoted lines to himself,
“I took the box to the north cliff.... I
hid it in the pocket in the rocks. There are two veins
that make a mark like a cross.” Very good; that
was plain. And as soon as the after-breakfast
chores were done he said, rather self-consciously,
“I know where there’s a pool full of cunners,” and
picking up his fishing-rod and tackle, he hurried
into the woods.</p>

<p>He looked back over his shoulder once or twice,
but no one was following him. Through the thickets,
dappled with sunshine, he went at a brisk trot. This
brought him out on the north shore, where the high
rocks towered above the beach like a line of battlements.
He swung himself over a cliff and dropped
lightly on to the sand. Leaving his fishing-rod in a
convenient place where he could pick it up quickly
if anyone came by, he began his search.</p>

<p>There were crevices in the rocks, and each of
these had to be explored. Bushes and trailing vines,
growing from little footholds, covered the seaward
surface of many of the cliffs. But Ben, thrilled
with the sense of exploration, and persevering by
nature, stuck to his task, and was rewarded at last
by finding what he sought, two veins of a light yellow
color that made the distinct mark of a cross.</p>

<p>“That’s it!” he muttered, excited. “And, by
Jove, there’s the pocket!”</p>

<p>Down on his knees he went, and thrust his head
into an opening. He pushed himself forward by digging
his toes in the sand. And soon his outstretched
hand touched a large chest, he felt metal bands about
it, he pushed it, but it was wedged in tight.</p>

<p>Presently he pulled himself out, stood up, and
considered the situation. He had found the box
that James Sampson had hid in the rocks. His first
thought was what a tremendously strong man
Sampson must have been to carry such a chest all
the way from Cotterell Hall to this north shore.
However, Sampson might not have carried it; he
might have brought it in a cart or by some other
means. And his next thought was, how could
Benjamin Sully get that chest out of the pocket.</p>

<p>That took a good deal of thinking, and he sat
down and considered it from various angles.</p>

<p>Into his brown study two voices from somewhere
back of him made interruption abruptly.</p>

<p>“He’s fishing for cunners on the dry sand!
First time I ever saw that done. He just coaxes ’em
out of the water.”</p>

<p>“Keep quiet! He’s counting the grains of sand.
He’s got up into the millions.”</p>

<p>“He’s thinking up a way to hypnotize the fish.
Stare at them hard enough, and they’ll swim right
up on the beach.”</p>

<p>“He’s copying King Canute. Telling the waves
to go back.”</p>

<p>“He’s working out a time-table for the tides.”</p>

<p>Ben turned his head. “As a matter of fact, the
thing I’m thinking about is a thousand times more
interesting than anything you’ve guessed.”</p>

<p>The two voices were those of David and Tom.</p>

<p>“I’ve always said,” observed David, “that you
can’t catch our Benjie napping. He seems to be
sitting there like a bump on a log, but he’s really
thinking of the most remarkable things.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder,” nodded Tom, “if it was
something utterly prodigious—like why the water’s
wet or fish have scales.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Ben pleasantly, “I was wondering
how I could get Peter Cotterell’s treasure chest out
of the place where his servant James Sampson hid it.
It’s rather too heavy for me to handle by myself.”</p>

<p>The other two stared. “Benjie oughtn’t to have
come out here without a cork helmet,” said David.
“I suppose he’s got a sunstroke.”</p>

<div class='imgcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-136.jpg' alt='' id='img3'/>
<p class='caption'>“Sampson put the chest there,” he concluded.</p>
</div>

<p>“What are you driving at?” asked Tom. “Have
you really found the treasure, Ben?”</p>

<p>Ben pointed negligently toward the cleft in the
rock. “There,” he answered. “See that yellow
cross? That marks where he hid the chest.”</p>

<p>“You’re dreaming!” David snorted.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” questioned Tom.</p>

<p>Ben took from his pocket the piece of paper that
bore James Sampson’s message. He read it aloud,
slowly, giving each word full weight. “Sampson
put the chest there,” he concluded. “And there it is
now. I crawled in and found it.”</p>

<p>Even David was impressed by that. He got
down on his knees and poked into the cavern, and
when he stood up he nodded solemnly.</p>

<p>“There is something in there,” he said. “I
shouldn’t wonder if Ben might be right.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tom, “there’s a rope in the sailboat.
We left her around the point.” He hurried
away.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he was back, with a coil of
good-sized rope.</p>

<p>Taking an end of this, Ben again crawled into the
opening and made the rope tight about the chest.
Then the three boys took hold of the other end
of the rope and began to pull. The sand was not
very secure footing and the chest was heavy, but
gradually they pulled it out. They discovered it was
a box made of hard wood, with iron fastenings.</p>

<p>“Well,” declared Tom, “if James Sampson
carried that all the way here by himself, all I’ve got
to say is that he deserves his name.”</p>

<p>“These mahogany men,” added David, “supposing
that the fellow who carried this chest was
a mahogany man—must belong to a race of giants.
I wonder if it was a mahogany man who made those
footprints on the edge of the creek?”</p>

<p>Ben had picked up a flat stone, shaped something
like a large Indian arrowhead, and another round
stone; and inserting the first stone under the lid of
the chest, he struck it several blows with the other.</p>

<p>Tom watched him a moment. “You can’t pry
it open that way,” he asserted. Looking along the
beach, he selected a big, egg-shaped stone and
brought it back to the chest. Lifting it in both
hands, he dropped it on the iron band just above the
lock. The iron snapped apart. The stone bounced
off on the sand.</p>

<p>David and Ben seized the lid. With a creaking
of hinges it was lifted. There before them was a
light blue coat, gold-braided, a three-cornered hat of
felt, a sword in a tarnished scabbard.</p>

<p>“My eye!” exclaimed Tom. “Just clothes!
Why in the world did he want to hide such things?”</p>

<p>Ben was flinging them aside. Underneath were
other garments, several suits of the style worn by
gentlemen in Revolutionary days, and then the oddest
collection of bric-a-brac, candlesticks, pewter
pitchers, a silver snuff-box, a couple of lacquered
platters, and even some china plates.</p>

<p>David started to laugh. “Well, if that’s the
Cotterell treasure, I can’t give it much! I don’t see
why the Barmouth people wanted to lay hands on
it, or why Sir Peter and his precious James Sampson
were so eager to get away with it. Why, it’s regular
junk-shop stuff. I don’t suppose the whole collection,
if they’d sold it at auction, would have fetched
enough to feed a soldier a week.”</p>

<p>Ben looked very much crestfallen. He fingered
the suits, the snuff-box, the platters. “No,” he
said, “it does seem mighty queer. And to think that
Sampson brought these things over here, intending
to take them away in a boat! I don’t understand
it at all.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Benjie.” Tom slapped his friend
on the shoulder. “You found the chest anyway.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. You did,” said David. “You
worked out the puzzle. It isn’t your fault if the
treasure was just old junk.”</p>

<p>Ben was scratching his head. “But surely Sir
Peter did have some valuable plate,” he argued.
“The people of Barmouth knew that. Then what
did he do with it?”</p>

<p>“Maybe he melted it down himself,” said David.
“Anyhow it isn’t in that chest.”</p>

<p>“That’s so.” Ben picked up the snuff-box and
stuck it in his pocket. “Where’s the Professor?”</p>

<p>“He went up to the house. Said he was going
to write a letter,” Tom answered. “I’ll tell you
what we’ll do, old sport. I’ll take you out in the
<span class='it'>Argo</span> and let you have some fishing.”</p>

<p>The chest was shut again and pushed back into
the pocket. Ben regained his fishing-rod and tackle,
and the three embarked in the sailboat. And presently
the satisfaction of pulling flounders on board
made Ben forget everything else.</p>

<p>When they returned to camp, with a fine catch of
fish, they found John Tuckerman busy preparing
dinner. Ben told his story, while Tuckerman listened
with the greatest interest. “It does seem odd,” he
said, when Ben had finished. “Most peculiar, in
fact.” He mused a moment, his eyes regarding
the water. “But then my good old ancestor Sir
Peter was an odd kind of fish. I wonder now—do
you suppose he could possibly have been planning
to have a joke at the expense of his Barmouth
neighbors?”</p>

<p>“You mean,” said Tom, “that he might have
hid those things expecting the neighbors to
find them?”</p>

<p>Tuckerman nodded. “It might have been so.
Perhaps he, or James Sampson, even expected the
men in the boat that was waiting off shore to find
where Sampson hid the chest.”</p>

<p>“But why all this puzzle then about the pieces
of parchment Ben found in the house?” asked David.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll admit,” said Tuckerman with a
smile, “that it’s not as clear as a pikestaff. Only
Sir Peter does seem to have liked his joke. However,
the bacon’s sizzling.” Brandishing a fork in
his hand, he bent over the frying pan.</p>

<p>That afternoon Tuckerman said that he had an
important letter to mail, and the campers sailed to
Barmouth. Tuckerman went to the post-office, and
each of the boys dropped in on his family. Ben had
a chat with his mother, then told her he must do an
errand. This took him into a side street, where there
were a number of small, unpretentious shops.</p>

<p>He stopped before a window that was filled with
old furniture, andirons, odds and ends of china. He
opened the door, and a little bell tinkled somewhere
back in the house, and after a moment a small,
wizened-faced man, wearing a big blue checked
apron, came into the room.</p>

<p>“Afternoon, Mr. Haskins,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“It’s Ben Sully, ain’t it?” said the proprietor.
“Well, are you goin’ to get married, an’ want a
nice set of furniture to go to housekeepin’ with?”</p>

<p>“Not to-day, Mr. Haskins.” Ben acknowledged
the joke with a grin. “No, sir, I’m more interested
just as present in what you call antiques.”</p>

<p>“Antiques, eh? Well, what was you thinkin’
of wantin’? I’ve some nice three-legged kettles, a
soup tureen that came over in the <span class='it'>Mayflower</span>, an
ivory back-scratcher that hails from India. Just
look about, an’ tell me what you want.”</p>

<p>“I want you to tell me something about this.”
Ben put his hand in his pocket and drew out the snuffbox
he had taken from the Cotterell chest.</p>

<p>“This?” Mr. Haskins took the snuff-box,
pulled his spectacles down from his forehead on to
his nose, walked nearer the window, and peered at
the small silver box.</p>

<p>“What do you want me to tell you?” he asked
after a moment.</p>

<p>“Is it a real old one?”</p>

<p>“Certainly it is. See that monogram? That’s
the finest embossed work.” Mr. Haskins gave a
chuckle. “I ought to know about that box, I ought.”</p>

<p>“Why ought you?” asked Ben.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, this here particular snuff-box has
been in my shop some time. I sold it to a customer
just about a week ago.”</p>

<p>“I thought perhaps you had,” said Ben, trying
hard not to show his excitement.</p>

<h1 id='t3880'>X—LIGHTS ON THE ISLAND</h1>

<p>The information that Ben obtained that afternoon
from Mr. Haskins concerning his sale of the
snuff-box gave a new direction to his thoughts. He
could not follow up this new clue just yet, however,
without telling the others, and this he didn’t want to
do. They would be waiting for him aboard the <span class='it'>Argo</span>,
and so, after a fifteen-minute talk with the shopkeeper,
he hurried away to join them at the wharf.</p>

<p>One other thing he did, however, before the sailboat
left Barmouth, and that was to get a canoe he
owned out from a shed on the waterfront and fasten
it behind the <span class='it'>Argo</span>. If he had the <span class='it'>Red Rover</span> with
him—he had laboriously painted that name in orange
letters on a scarlet background on the canoe—he
would be able to come and go about the harbor as he
wished and to leave the island without explaining
his plans, as he would have to do if he wanted
to take the sailboat.</p>

<p>“What’s the idea?” asked David, who never
overlooked a chance to ask a question. “Are you
going to teach the Professor how to paddle a canoe?”</p>

<p>Ben nodded. “I thought that ought to be part
of his education. The <span class='it'>Red Rover’s</span> steady enough
for any beginner to paddle.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman looked askance at the little craft bobbing
up and down in the wake of the <span class='it'>Argo</span>. “Any
canoe’s unsteady enough for me to upset in, I guess.
However, I like Ben’s idea. It was thoughtful of
you, my lad.”</p>

<p>At that they all laughed, for whatever Ben’s
reason had been for wanting the canoe at the island
it was fairly obvious that he was not taking it there
to further John Tuckerman’s seafaring education.</p>

<p>That evening, however, Tuckerman reminded
Ben of his suggestion. The water was calm, the
breeze was light. “How about a paddle?” he asked.
“Just along the shore? I promise not to rock
the boat.”</p>

<p>“Righto,” said Ben. “Come on.”</p>

<p>They went to the landing-stage at the pier and
put the canoe in the water. Ben got in at the stern
and balanced the boat while Tuckerman gingerly
stepped in and squatted down at the bow.</p>

<p>“Not much room for long legs,” said
Tuckerman. “I’ll have to tie mine up in a bow.”</p>

<p>“You’ll get used to it soon,” encouraged Ben.
“I’ll do the steering. All you have to do is to put
your paddle in, give a long, slow push, and take it
out again.”</p>

<p>“Sounds easy enough.” Tuckerman tried to
shift the position of his knees, with the result that
the canoe rolled over almost far enough to ship a
gallon of water. He threw his weight the other way,
and the canoe nearly capsized.</p>

<p>“Plague take it!” he muttered. “It’s worse
than walking a tight-rope!”</p>

<p>“Easy there, easy,” laughed Ben. “First rule
in a canoe is never to move quickly. When you shift
your weight, do it slowly. Pretty soon it’ll come as
natural as riding a bicycle.”</p>

<p>“Riding a balky horse, you mean,” said
Tuckerman. “All right; I’ll remember.” He dipped
the tip of his paddle into the water and gave a
tiny shove.</p>

<p>Ben gave a long sweep with his paddle, a dexterous
twist at the end of the stroke, and the <span class='it'>Red
Rover</span> floated smoothly away from the landing-stage.</p>

<p>With Ben’s coaching, Tuckerman soon was able
to paddle fairly well. He found it somewhat difficult
to keep the bow evenly balanced, but as Ben anticipated
his movements and shifted automatically from
side to side, Tuckerman gained confidence and soon
was sitting steady.</p>

<p>They paddled along shore, past the camp and on
to the upper end of the island. Tuckerman, feeling
more and more at ease, was delighted with the
motion, with the gentle swish of the water, with the
still, starlit night, with the panorama of beach and
cliffs and woods as they floated by.</p>

<p>“Let’s go on around the island,” he suggested.
“This isn’t real work at all.”</p>

<p>Ben smiled to himself. He knew that Tuckerman
would discover next morning several muscles in his
back and shoulders that he wasn’t accustomed to feeling.
But the night was perfect for a paddle. “All
right,” he agreed. “No, don’t you try to do any
steering. The man in the stern does that.” With a
couple of twists he turned the bow to the north.
“There,” he said, “there’s the cliff where Sampson
hid the chest in the pocket.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman turned to look. The <span class='it'>Red Rover</span>
wobbled, slanted.</p>

<p>Ben shifted and righted her quickly. “Hi
there!” he warned.</p>

<p>“My mistake,” said the penitent Tuckerman. “I
see that it won’t do for me to think of two things
at once when I’m out on this lily-pad.”</p>

<p>“Paddle—quickly now,” Ben ordered. “But
not too quickly. There’s a rip off that ledge.”</p>

<p>They passed the rip and came into smoother
water. Presently they were on the ocean side of the
island. “There’s the creek where we saw the footprints,”
said Ben.</p>

<p>“Don’t point out anything else to me,” said
Tuckerman. “If I move my left leg I can’t get it
back in place.”</p>

<p>By the time they reached the southern end of the
island the bow-paddler felt as if the muscles of his
knees were tied in hard knots. “Do you mind,” he
said in a tone of apology, “if I stop paddling for a
couple of minutes and unwind myself? I’ll move
very slowly.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Ben. “I’ll balance the canoe.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman pushed himself back, then very
carefully unwound his long legs, stretched them out with
an exclamation of relief, rubbed the muscles, and
then readjusted himself in a new and more comfortable
position. “I suppose to be a really proficient
canoeist,” he observed, “one ought to be made
of rubber. There—how’s that? Didn’t I do
it cleverly?”</p>

<p>“Wonderful!” said Ben.</p>

<p>Tuckerman picked up his paddle again, and,
proud of his ability to move without rocking the
boat, stuck the paddle in the water and gave a mighty
sweep. The bow swung around, rocked, tilted;
Tuckerman pressed his arm hard on the left-hand
gunwale.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Professor!” cried Ben. “We don’t
want to head out into the ocean. Keep your paddle
out of the water. Steady there!” With alternate
strokes to right and left Ben soon had the canoe back
on its course parallel to the shore.</p>

<p>“I <span class='it'>am</span> a duffer,” muttered Tuckerman contritely.</p>

<p>“Oh no, you’re not,” said Ben. “You’re doing
very well. Only you must remember to let the stern
man do the steering. A little more practice and
you’ll find the <span class='it'>Red Rover</span> as easy to manage as falling
off a log.”</p>

<p>“Falling off a log is good,” was Tuckerman’s
comment. “Falling into the water would be more
like it.”</p>

<p>They rounded the lower end of the island and
came back on the bay side. They had almost reached
the landing-stage when Ben said, “See, there’s a
light at Cotterell Hall. It’s in the front door. It
looks like a pocket flashlight. I suppose Tom and
David went up there to get something.”</p>

<p>Cautiously Tuckerman looked in the direction of
the house. There was a small circle of light. It
moved away from the door; after a minute it shone
through a window.</p>

<p>“I thought I locked the doors,” he said. “However,
they may have climbed in through a window.”</p>

<p>The light disappeared. The canoe floated
smoothly up to the stage, and Ben held it level while
Tuckerman climbed out. Ben jumped up lightly.
Then they both pulled the <span class='it'>Red Rover</span> out and turned
it bottom side up.</p>

<p>They went up the walk to the house. The front
door was shut, and when Tuckerman turned the
knob he found that the door was locked. He opened
it with his own key, and the two went in. The hall
and the rooms were dark, there was no sound of
voices or footsteps anywhere.</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” said Tuckerman. “We didn’t
see Tom and David come down the path. Maybe
they went out the back way.”</p>

<p>But the kitchen door was locked, and when the
two opened it and looked out there was no sign of
the others leaving in that direction.</p>

<p>“I wonder what they’ve been up to?” said Ben.
“Playing some joke perhaps.”</p>

<p>They returned to the camp, and there were Tom
and David, toasting marshmallows on long sticks
over a bed of hot coals.</p>

<p>“We were betting ten to one,” said David, “that
you’d come back nice and wet. Want to dry your
clothes at the fire?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” answered Tuckerman. “We’ve
been all round the island, and we didn’t ship a
thimbleful of water.”</p>

<p>Tom glanced at Ben. “The Professor hasn’t
been fooling us, has he? He didn’t know all about
handling a canoe, did he?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Ben with a smile. “He didn’t know
all about handling a canoe when we started. But he
knows almost everything about it now.” Then, as
he sat down cross-legged on the grass, Ben said
carelessly, “We saw your light in the house. I
suppose you climbed in through a window.”</p>

<p>“Saw our light in the house?” Tom echoed.
“What are you giving us?”</p>

<p>His tone was perfectly sincere. Ben saw that he
wasn’t joking.</p>

<p>“Well, we certainly saw some light,” Tuckerman
stated. “It looked like a pocket flashlight, at the
front door and at one of the windows.”</p>

<p>“Not guilty,” said David. “Are you sure it
wasn’t a firefly?”</p>

<p>“You two have been right here ever since we
left?” asked Ben.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the two in chorus.</p>

<p>“And you haven’t seen anyone land, or heard
anyone?” Ben continued.</p>

<p>“No,” came the chorus.</p>

<p>Ben looked at Tuckerman. “Well, someone was
in the house. How about that, Professor?”</p>

<p>“Somebody was. But I can’t imagine what
they could have been doing. I don’t suppose they
were thieves.”</p>

<p>“It’s my opinion,” said David sagely, “that they
were hunting for the famous Cotterell treasure. And
now that you’ve found it, Benjie, I’d suggest that
you put up a big placard, stating ‘The treasure has
been found. No seekers need apply.’”</p>

<p>“Very good,” said Ben. “Only the real treasure
hasn’t been found, you see.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed David.</p>

<p>“No,” said Ben, “that’s my humble opinion.”
And then, as if he wanted to change the subject,
he added, “I’m going to toast one large, juicy
marshmallow, and then I’m going to turn in.”</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later the moon, riding up in the
sky, looked down through the branches and saw that
the four campers were sound asleep. There was the
lap-lap of waves, the gentle purring noise as the water
washed over pebbles, and in the tops of the pines
a soft lullaby of the breeze.</p>

<p>Tom stirred, turned, opened his eyes. It seemed
to him that something had waked him. He looked
about; there was only the familiar scene. He gave a
satisfied grunt and curled his head in the hollow of
his arm. Then he looked around again to make
sure that they had put out all the embers of the fire.
And at some distance through the woods, in the
direction of the pier, he saw a light that moved.</p>

<p>Immediately he remembered what Ben and
Tuckerman had said about seeing a light in the
house. Noiselessly he got up, pulled on his shoes
and stuck his arms in his jacket. Through the
woods he stole, stealthy as an Indian. The light
had disappeared, but he thought he heard the sound
of feet on the planks of the pier.</p>

<p>He came to the trees nearest to the clearing about
Cotterell Hall. The house was dark; there was no
sound or light in the neighborhood. But he was
convinced that there had been someone there, and
presently he darted forward and crossed the open
space to the shelter of the porch.</p>

<p>After a few minutes he stole to the corner of the
house, and now his search was rewarded. Someone
was leaving by the kitchen door. In the moonlight
he counted three figures. They were heading away
from the shore, toward the grove at the back; he
guessed that they intended to take the path that led
down to the creek.</p>

<p>Tom followed them at a distance. They went
through the woods, and now he saw the moonlight
on the water. They had reached the head of the
creek, but they didn’t stop there. They went on
along the bank to the higher shore where the creek
flowed into the ocean. Then for the first time Tom
noticed the silver tip of a sail. Lying flat behind a
bush, he watched the three men go to the rim of
the shore, and, one after another, slide over the edge
where the boat waited.</p>

<p>He wanted to see that boat, to get a closer view
of the men; but there were no bushes between him
and the shore. Now the tip of the sail was bobbing,
now it was filling out; presently it was moving to the
southward, a white wing, still as a floating gull.</p>

<p>He crept forward and watched. The boat was
stealing away, soon she was only a dancing speck
of white in the glittering moonpath. He had no way
of identifying her or of making out her crew. He
noted that she did not turn or tack when she came
to the lower end of the island, but held on to a course
that would bring her south along the main shore.</p>

<p>Tom stood up and eased his feelings by a long
whistle. “What were they doing here? It must
be something mighty important,” he said aloud.</p>

<p>No answer occurred to him, and after watching
the sail until it disappeared in the distance he turned
and walked back to the house.</p>

<p>He tried both the doors; they were locked. He
looked at the lower windows; they were all closed.
He went down to the pier; the <span class='it'>Argo</span> was there and
the <span class='it'>Red Rover</span>; there was nothing to tell him what
these night-time prowlers had been doing.</p>

<p>He went back by the beach to the camp. As he
stepped up on to the bank Ben opened his eyes and
sat up. “Hello,” he said sleepily. “Why, Tom,
what are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Sh-ssh,” murmured Tom.</p>

<p>Ben rubbed his eyes, crawled out of his bed,
caught Tom’s arm, and pulled him down to the beach.
“What were you doing?” he demanded in an insistent
whisper.</p>

<p>“Well, I saw a light, and I went to find out
what it was.”</p>

<p>“Yes? And you saw them, did you?”</p>

<p>“Saw whom, Benjie?”</p>

<p>“Saw the pirates, did you?”</p>

<p>“The pirates! You’re half-asleep. What are
you talking about?”</p>

<p>Ben nodded his head. “Oh, I know something
about them.”</p>

<p>“Well, I saw three men. They went away in
a sailboat.”</p>

<p>“Who were they? What did they look like?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I didn’t get very close.”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d taken me along with you. I’ll bet
I’d have found out something.”</p>

<p>That nettled Tom, and he answered more loudly,
“Oh, you would, would you? I thought you knew
all about them.”</p>

<p>“Sh-ssh,” muttered Ben. But David had
wakened now, and his voice boomed out, “What are
you two lobsters quarreling over?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Tom. “Keep quiet, or you’ll
wake the Professor.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman sat up. “You don’t mean to say
it’s morning!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“No, it’s not,” Tom answered. “Can’t a fellow
take a stroll in the moonlight without rousing the
whole town?”</p>

<p>“Stroll in the moonlight!” chuckled David.</p>

<p>“Go on with your beauty sleep, Professor. That’s
what I’m going to do. Let the two lobsters fight
it out.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the sleepy Tuckerman, nestling
down again.</p>

<p>Tom turned to Ben. “So you know something
about these pirates, do you?” he asked. “What
were they doing here?”</p>

<p>“That,” said Ben, “is going to take some thinking.
You see what you can find out, and I’ll see
what I can. They won’t be back here to-night. And
I’m too doggone sleepy to argue anyhow.”</p>

<h1 id='t4318'>XI—THE MAN IN GREEN</h1>

<p>Ben, having explained to the other three campers
that he had important business to attend to in
Barmouth, set out in the <span class='it'>Red Rover</span> directly after
breakfast the next morning. He paddled the canoe
across the bay, landed at the town wharf, and went
up the main street to Barmouth’s one good hotel.
He knew the clerk, Mr. Pollock, and after saying
“Good morning” very politely, he helped himself
to a small folded automobile map from a pile that
lay on the counter for anyone to take.</p>

<p>“Going motoring, Ben?” asked the clerk.
“Seems to me I heard you were camping on
Cotterell’s Island. How are things over there?”</p>

<p>“Fine,” said Ben; and in return he promptly
asked a question. “Had many automobile parties
for dinner the past few days?”</p>

<p>“Quite a lot. Yes, business is pretty good.
They like our special broiled lobster dinners.”</p>

<p>Ben leaned on the counter, copying the familiar
manner he had noted in hotel guests. “You had a
party on Tuesday, didn’t you? A big red car, with
a Massachusetts license, driven by a man in green-checked
knickerbockers?”</p>

<p>“Expect me to remember that?” Nevertheless,
Mr. Pollock scratched his chin and considered the
question. “Yes, seems to me I do recall such a
party. Somebody said those knickerbockers were
loud enough to be heard all the way to Boston.”
The clerk thumbed the pages of the hotel register
and presently pointed out a name. “That’s the fellow,
Joseph Hastings. He comes from Cleveland,
Ohio. There were four in his party.”</p>

<p>“And he came in a big red car, with a silver
eagle on the radiator cap?” Ben persisted.</p>

<p>“Well, now, I can’t say as to that.” But Mr.
Pollock, being a good-natured man and having nothing
else to do at the moment, scratched his chin
again, and again considered. “I do think of something.
He told me he’d punctured a tire and asked
me the best place to go to buy a new one.”</p>

<p>Ben nodded. “I suppose you told him
Hammond’s?”</p>

<p>“You’re right. I did. Frank Hammond is a
good friend of mine.”</p>

<p>Then Ben changed the conversation to the
subject of the big league pennant race, in which the
clerk was very much interested, and after some
further chat, departed from the hotel.</p>

<p>Frank Hammond knew Ben also, and was not too
busy that morning to exchange a few words with
him. After a number of questions about the state
of the roads in the neighborhood of Barmouth, Ben
said, “Mr. Pollock tells me you sold a tire to Joseph
Hastings, of Cleveland, Ohio, Tuesday of this week.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Mr. Hammond, “I did. I
sold him a couple of those big Vulcan tires for his
rear wheels. Is he a friend of yours?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know him very well,” Ben evaded.
“But I hear he’s a fine fellow. Is he touring along
the coast?”</p>

<p>“No. He said he was staying at a place called
the Gables, down on the Cape Ann Road. Wonderful
car he’s got. He told me he’d had it built
according to his own ideas.”</p>

<p>“Big red car, with a silver eagle on the radiator
cap?”</p>

<p>“That’s the bird. Yes, sir, he must be a
millionaire.”</p>

<p>When he left the dealer in automobile supplies
Ben went to his uncle’s house and secured the loan of
a small, ramshackle car he had often driven before.
He made sure that the car had plenty of gasoline
and oil, that the radiator was full of water, and he
took a look at the tires. Then he drove south from
Barmouth over the State Road.</p>

<p>It was a fine day, and many cars were out. Ben
kept a watchful eye for such a car as that of Joseph
Hastings, but none answering the description passed
him. So he jogged along until he came to the fork
of the Cape Ann Road and turned into it. There
were fewer automobiles here, the road was not made
for speeding, the little car bounced about a good deal
going over ruts, and rattled like a load of tinware.</p>

<p>He met a boy on a bicycle and asked him if he
knew a place called the Gables.</p>

<p>“Down the road a couple of miles,” the boy told
him. “Big house with a ship for a weather-vane.”</p>

<p>Ben thanked him and drove on. Pretty soon he
saw the weather-vane on a roof to the left of
the road.</p>

<p>The Gables had a wide lawn, stretching down
to a stone wall. The entrance to the drive was at
the southern end, and the gateposts were flanked
with larches. Ben drove to the gate, and stopped.
So far his plan had been simple; now he was undecided
what course to follow next.</p>

<p>He was musing over this when a voice hailed him.</p>

<p>“Give you greetings, sir. May I ask what
you’re pondering over?”</p>

<p>The words were so peculiar that Ben looked
around in surprise. A young man had stepped out
from among the trees and was nodding at him.</p>

<p>“Why—good-morning,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“Has your car run out of juice?”</p>

<p>The man came up, a broad smile on his face.
He himself looked very much like any sunburned
fellow; but his costume was most peculiar. He wore
a tight-fitting jacket of green, open at the throat,
without any necktie. His knee-breeches were green,
too, and so were his stockings, and on his low brown
shoes were large brass buckles.</p>

<p>“No,” said Ben, with an answering smile, for
there was a twinkle in the stranger’s eye as if he knew
some joke, “I’ve gasoline enough to run this car
all day. I’ll admit it isn’t the very latest model—not
what you’d call a show car—but we do get wonderful
mileage per gallon of gas.”</p>

<p>“Don’t make any apologies for your equipage,”
said the gentleman in green. “Many a valiant
knight has ridden on a steed that wouldn’t have taken
the blue ribbon at the horse show. Don Quixote, for
example. You remember him, of course? The
Spanish cavalier who rode forth to tilt at windmills?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ben with a laugh. And then, seeing
that the man was friendly, he added, “That’s a
wonderful suit of clothes you’re wearing.”</p>

<p>“You like it?” The owner looked down at his
costume. “I designed it myself. It seems to me an
improvement on the usual thing. And now, kind sir,
since you tell me that your steed has plenty of fodder,
may I ask how you happen to be sitting here on
such a fine day?”</p>

<p>“This place is called the Gables, isn’t it?” asked
Ben. “Mr. Joseph Hastings lives here?”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” answered the man. “But Mr.
Hastings isn’t at home this morning. Did you have
business with him?”</p>

<p>“In a way. I wanted to find out if he’d lost a
silver snuff-box.”</p>

<p>“A snuff-box? That’s interesting. But I don’t
think Joseph Hastings takes snuff.”</p>

<p>Ben drew the box from his pocket. The man in
green looked at it. “Now where did you find
this?” he asked.</p>

<p>“On an island in Barmouth Harbor,” said Ben.
“Cotterell’s Island, it’s called.”</p>

<p>“Well!” exclaimed the man. “Well, well—you
don’t say so!” He looked at the boy in the car
with a new interest. “So that’s where you come
from, is it?” He returned the snuff-box. “May I
be so inquisitive as to ask your name?”</p>

<p>“Benjamin Sully.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. My own appellation is Roderick
Fitzhugh. If you have no objection, Mr. Sully, I
should greatly enjoy the pleasure of riding with you.”</p>

<p>Ben didn’t know what to say; and Mr. Fitzhugh
evidently took his silence for consent, for he immediately
hopped into the seat beside the driver.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Ben; “but you see I
wasn’t thinking of riding anywhere. I came to
find out whether Mr. Hastings had lost a snuff-box
on Cotterell’s Island.”</p>

<p>“Just so. But you can’t find that out, as he’s
not at home at present. And meantime I suggest
that we go on a little adventure. A fine day, a steed
with plenty of gasoline, and two gentlemen looking
for amusement.”</p>

<p>Ben was mystified. “What sort of adventure?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Well, what would you say to hunting for
hooked-rugs?”</p>

<p>“Hooked-rugs?” Ben laughed; he was now so
much amused at Roderick Fitzhugh’s company that
he wanted to see more of him. “Do they grow
on bushes?”</p>

<p>“No. They grow in these thrifty Yankee cottages.
I’ll tell you where to go.”</p>

<p>Ben started the engine and drove on. At his
companion’s direction he soon turned into a by-road
that led westward.</p>

<p>Roderick Fitzhugh nodded toward a cottage, in
the yard of which a woman was scattering grain to
a flock of chickens. “There is a likely-looking
hunting-ground,” he said. “Please stop when you
come to the gate. I will exchange a few words with
this respectable lady.”</p>

<p>The car stopped, making its customary noise of
clattering tinware as Ben put on the brake. The
woman looked round, and in the usual neighborly
fashion of farmers walked over to the gate.</p>

<p>“Morning,” she said.</p>

<p>“Good morning to you, Madam,” responded
Roderick Fitzhugh. “You have a fine flock of hens.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, looking at the man in the green
clothes as if she didn’t know exactly what to make
of him.</p>

<p>“My friend and I,” continued Fitzhugh, “were
just discussing the subject of hooked-rugs. As soon
as I saw you I said, ‘There’s a woman who knows
all about them.’” His tone was so deferential that
anyone would have been pleased to be addressed in
such a manner.</p>

<p>The woman smiled. “Well, now, I don’t know
as how I know all about them; but I do have a few
old rugs. Been in the family some time.”</p>

<p>“You see!” exclaimed Fitzhugh, turning to Ben.
And to the woman he added, “Would it be possible
for my friend and me to have a look at them?”</p>

<p>“Surely it would. But they’re not the new
shiny kind you can buy at the stores in the city.”</p>

<p>Fitzhugh and Ben descended and followed the
woman indoors. Presently they were viewing half-a-dozen
antique rugs, all of the hooked variety, that
the woman collected from the upstairs rooms.</p>

<p>Ben looked on with interest and amusement while
his new friend discussed the rugs with their owner.
And after listening to Fitzhugh’s admiration for
these things that she evidently regarded as rather
faded and only fit for service in bedrooms and attic,
the woman said, “I’d be pleased to have you take
one, if you care to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, madam, you are too generous,” Fitzhugh
answered. “And yet I should like to have one.
That medium-sized one, with the purple border. I’d
be glad to pay five dollars for it.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s not worth that much.”</p>

<p>“It is to me,” said Fitzhugh, and he brought
out a five-dollar bill from his trouser pocket and laid
it on the table.</p>

<p>With the rug they returned to the car. As they
drove on again Fitzhugh said, “They used to tell
me, when I was a small boy, that you could take one
egg from a nest, and if there were several others left
the mother bird wouldn’t know the difference. I
don’t know whether that’s so. But I’m certain this
good woman won’t miss that rug very much. So
my conscience is easy, though I got that prize at a
bargain. Now, Mr. Benjamin Sully, what do you
say? Isn’t hunting for hooked-rugs exciting?”</p>

<p>It was fun to hunt them with this amusing companion.
Fitzhugh collected three more at three other
houses, paying five dollars for each. At the third
house the farmer and his wife and children were
just sitting down to dinner and the strangers were
invited to join them. They had an excellent meal,
during which the man in green did almost all the
talking, and when they returned to the car and
started on again he rubbed his hands gleefully and
said, “Mr. Benjamin Sully, it isn’t so hard to find
adventures if you look for them, is it?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Ben answered, “this is all very well;
but I set out this morning to see Mr. Hastings
and learn if he’d lost a snuff-box.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, you did. Joseph Hastings—a silver
snuff-box—found on Cotterell’s Island. What makes
you think that the snuff-box you found there belonged
to Joseph Hastings?”</p>

<p>Ben considered how much to tell this Roderick
Fitzhugh, and finally decided to supply him with
more facts. “The snuff-box was bought by Mr.
Hastings at a shop in Barmouth, and I found it
yesterday in a chest hidden in a crevice in the rocks
on the island. Why did he put it there?”</p>

<p>The man in green beamed with delight. “In a
treasure chest? Why, that’s splendid!” He looked
at Ben with new approval in his eyes. “So you’re
mixed up in a real adventure, are you? Treasure
hidden in the rocks—on an island! Why, that’s
magnificent! No wonder you didn’t get excited
over my tame hooked-rugs. Turn the car about, and
drive back to the Gables. We must investigate this.”</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later the little car turned in between
the gate-posts at the Gables. It clattered up the
drive to the front of the house. On the wide porch
were at least a dozen people, men and women; and
when they saw the occupants of the car they gave a
shout of welcome.</p>

<p>“Hello, here’s the lad in green!”</p>

<p>“We thought you’d been kidnapped!”</p>

<p>“Where’d you find the jitney?”</p>

<p>“Hope you’ve had some lunch!”</p>

<p>“We thought you’d been arrested as a suspicious
character in those clothes!”</p>

<p>These were some of the exclamations.</p>

<p>The man got out of the car and threw his bundle
of rugs on the steps of the porch. “My good
friends,” he said, “Roderick Fitzhugh has been adventuring,
and there’s his booty. Four beautiful
hooked-rugs to add to the collection. And this is
Mr. Benjamin Sully. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr.
Sully has found a silver snuff-box belonging to
Joseph Hastings in a treasure chest on Cotterel’s
Island. What do you think of that?”</p>

<p>There was another chorus of exclamations, expressive
of great surprise.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sully,” the man in green continued, “if
you’ll get down from your steed we will partake of
a long glass of lemonade—two glasses to be exact.”</p>

<p>Ben climbed down and went up the steps. And
then he noticed that all the people on the porch were
dressed in quaint costumes, as milkmaids or archers
or foresters. He looked at Fitzhugh, and the latter
nodded. “Queer crowd, aren’t they?” said
Fitzhugh. “However, they won’t bite.”</p>

<h1 id='t4705'>XII—THE ADVENTURE AT THE COVE</h1>

<p>That same morning, while Ben had been hunting
for the owner of the red automobile with the
silver eagle on the radiator cap, Tom and David
and John Tuckerman had sailed down to Camp
Amoussock in the <span class='it'>Argo</span>. They found the boys at
the camp in their bathing-suits, practicing for some
water-sports that were to be held that week. A raft,
with a spring-board, was moored off shore, and from
this boys were diving and turning somersaults, backward
and forward, like acrobats in a circus.</p>

<p>Other boys were swimming, practising for races,
and still others were paddling round in tubs, trying
to steer with their feet while they propelled the tubs
forward by splashing the water with their hands.</p>

<p>“There,” said John Tuckerman, as he saw a fat
youngster revolving round and round in a tub,
“that’s the game for me. I believe, with my long
arms and legs, that I’d make a hit at it.”</p>

<p>The fat boy splashed too hard, and the tub went
over neatly. There was a shout of laughter as the
boy bobbed up in the water and tried to turn the
slippery tub rightside up again. This was hard
work; the tub went round and round, continually
evading his fingers; and finally he swam to shore,
pushing the tub before him.</p>

<p>“No,” said Tuckerman, “that isn’t the game for
me. I used to be pretty good at picking up a pea in
a tablespoon, but that was on dry land. When it
comes to wrestling with a tub in the water—” He
gave an expressive shrug—“I’d rather let the fishes
do it.”</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Argo</span> landed, and the three guests were provided
with bathing-suits from the camp’s supply.
For half-an-hour they swam and dived and perched
on the raft, watching the boys in tubs. Then a
bugle sounded on shore, telling them it was time to
get ready for dinner.</p>

<p>The guests did full justice to dinner, sitting between
Mr. Perkins, the Chief Counsellor, and
Lanky Larry. Afterwards Mr. Perkins and John
Tuckerman had a chat, while Lanky invited Tom
and David to take a walk along the shore.</p>

<p>“There’s a queer sort of place a couple of miles
to the south,” said Lanky. “It’s a cove with a lot
of shanties. Fishermen used to go there; there are
boats and nets lying around; but I think it must be
deserted. I saw some men there one day last week,
but they didn’t look like fishermen.”</p>

<p>“Lead us to it,” said David. “Deserted villages
are right in our line.”</p>

<p>The path along the shore brought them to the
cove. A little tidal river ran inland, wandering up
into marshes. On each side of the river was a stony
beach, and a rickety bridge, with a single handrail,
connected the banks of the stream. Small weatherbeaten
shacks, doors and shutters sagging outward,
fishing-dories, rusty anchors, lobster-pots, a few
nets with round black buoys, these cluttered up
either shore.</p>

<p>“Nice place, if it wasn’t for the shanties,” said
David, regarding the cove.</p>

<p>“I found a chap painting here one day,” said
Lanky. “He told me it made a great picture; he
liked the shanties first-rate.”</p>

<p>“Funny what things painters like,” chuckled
David. “The more ramshackle a house is, the more
they want to paint it.”</p>

<p>They went down a rocky path to the nearer
beach, and sat on the bottom of an upturned scow.
As they were chatting they heard the creak of a door,
opening on rusty hinges. A man came out from one
of the nearer shacks. His clothes were fairly new,
he wore a brown slouch hat and tan shoes—evidently
he was not a fisherman; neither was he a farmer
nor a common loafer; he looked as if he came from
a town. He was smoking a small briar pipe.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” The man’s tone
was a little peremptory, though not exactly surly.</p>

<p>David enjoyed such a question. With a pleasant,
friendly smile he answered, “Just sitting here
and thinking.”</p>

<p>“That’s all you’re doing, eh?”</p>

<p>“It is at present,” David answered. “What are
you doing yourself?”</p>

<p>The man frowned; looked up the creek, looked
across at the opposite shore. “Nobody lives here
now,” he stated after a minute. “Sometimes I come
and fish from that bridge.”</p>

<p>“What’s happened to the place?” asked Lanky.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Only nobody comes here now.”</p>

<p>“Well, we came this afternoon,” said David.
“You see, we’re explorers.”</p>

<p>“You won’t find anything to explore.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know about that.”</p>

<p>The man shot a glance at David, not a very
amiable glance. And with that he walked to the
bridge, crossed it, and went into the huddle of shacks
on the other bank.</p>

<p>“Pleasant sort of customer,” said Lanky.</p>

<p>“He’d make a cow laugh,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“He didn’t like our being here,” observed David,
“Now I wonder why.”</p>

<p>“He wants it all to himself,” said Lanky. “He
must be some sort of hermit.”</p>

<p>“And just for that,” said David, “I feel like
sitting right here on this scow till he gets
more hospitable.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, however, sitting on the upturned
boat and watching the waves surge gently up
over the stony beach and then withdraw in a network
of little rivulets that made the stones and pebbles
glisten was not entertaining enough to keep the
three boys there more than five minutes. Tom got
up. “I’m going over the bridge,” he said. “If our
friend the hermit doesn’t like it—well, he’ll just have
to lump it.”</p>

<p>The bridge shook as the three of them stepped
upon it. “For goodness sake, don’t lean against
that railing,” Lanky warned. “Stop bouncing up
and down as you walk, Dave, or you’ll have us all in
the water.”</p>

<p>David went on bouncing; but in spite of that they
reached the other shore safely. No one was to be
seen here; somewhere in the clutter of shanties the
man had disappeared.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what that precious hermit is
up to,” said David, and he walked toward the shacks
that were furthest from the bridge.</p>

<p>Lanky and Tom investigated in the other direction,
where a clump of oaks came close down to the
stream. At the edge of the trees was a shack a little
larger and better built than the others. The door
was open, and the two boys looked in. “Hello!”
exclaimed Tom. “What’s that on the bench? It
looks like jewelry.”</p>

<p>A brown cloak, a brown hat with a red feather
stuck at one side, and a chain of gold links with a
large green stone as a pendant, were piled on
the bench.</p>

<p>Tom picked up the ornament. “It’s imitation,”
he said. He looked around the room. “Why,
there’s a whole wardrobe of queer hats and cloaks
and things here!”</p>

<p>“So there is,” said Lanky. “What do you
suppose they are? Actors’ things?”</p>

<p>“Actors’ things?” Tom glanced at the outfit of
costumes that hung on pegs on one wall. “They’re
certainly not fishermen’s things. But what would
actors be doing in this cove?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Lanky admitted. “It is funny,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>They looked at the costumes more closely, and
then went out of the shack. “I wonder if that man
knows something about them,” Lanky suggested.
“He might have been keeping guard.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see what Dave’s doing,” said Tom, and
started along the bank.</p>

<p>He had only taken a few steps, however, when he
stopped. “Here comes a boat around the point.
Let’s beat it, and see what they do.”</p>

<p>The two slipped back of a cabin, then to a shelter
of bushes. Crouching there, they watched the
boat nose its bow into the cove.</p>

<p>The boat was a dory. One man was rowing, two
others sat in the stern. They looked no more like
the usual type of fishermen than had the man whom
the boys had first encountered.</p>

<p>With considerable splashing the boat was rowed
up to the bridge. The tide was low, and there was
hardly enough water at that point to float the dory.
The rower shipped his oars and tied the boat to the
railing of the bridge. Meantime the other two men
stepped over the side and came up on to the beach.</p>

<p>All three headed toward the shack that the boys
had just left and went in at the door.</p>

<p>“They seem to know their way about,” whispered
Lanky. “I wonder why Dave’s friend didn’t
come down to meet them.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes the three men came out again,
and now they had some of the cloaks and hats in
their hands. Each put on a cloak and a hat and
strutted about; they laughed and joked at each other.</p>

<p>“What in the world——” muttered Lanky.
“Actors. I told you,” Tom whispered. “They
look like highwaymen.”</p>

<p>The men now seemed satisfied with their costumes.
Hats pulled well down on their heads and
cloaks thrown over their shoulders, they took the
path toward the clump of oaks.</p>

<p>“I say,” muttered Lanky, “what do you suppose
they’re going to do? Hold up some farmer’s wagon?
Come on, I want to find out what’s their game.”</p>

<p>“I’d better get Dave,” said Tom. “You follow
them. I’ll catch up with you in a minute.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>Lanky went one way, and Tom the other.</p>

<p>Tom ran over the stones between the shanties,
and looked in at the open doors; but he did not see
David nor the man they had met first. He gave
the whistle he used to call David in Barmouth.
There was no answer. The shacks on this side of
the stream all appeared deserted.</p>

<p>David was not to be found, and Tom supposed
he must have gone further along the shore. Meantime
he would be losing the chance of finding Lanky,
so after whistling several times more Tom turned
and ran toward the oaks.</p>

<p>The path along the cove was well marked, it
traversed the high ground at the edge of the marshes
and turned into fairly thick woods. At a dog-trot
Tom soon came up with Lanky. “I couldn’t find
Dave,” he grunted. “I guess he found the hermit
so fascinating he went for a stroll with him.”</p>

<p>“I’ve kept my eye on the three highwaymen,”
said Lanky. “This seems to be the only path around
here, marshes on one side and the forest primeval
on the other.” He glanced at his wrist-watch. “I
ought to be getting back to camp; but I can’t leave
an adventure like this. It wouldn’t be decent,
would it?”</p>

<p>“It would not,” Tom assented. “If they try
to blame you, you refer them to me. I’ll say that
we thought those fellows were up to some kind of
mischief, and that it seemed to be our duty to investigate
them. And that’s telling the truth; they’re what
Benjie would call ‘suspicious characters.’”</p>

<p>Every once in a while the boys would catch a
glimpse of one or other of the cloaked men through
the vista of the trees. Then the boys would stop
and let the others get well ahead of them. And presently
they reached a dusty road and saw the men
tramping along to the south.</p>

<p>Tom and Lanky had to come out in the open
then, but, as Lanky pointed out, there was no reason
why the men, if they saw them, should think the two
boys were at all interested in what they were doing.
They walked a half-mile without encountering anyone,
and then the boys saw an automobile coming
toward the three in front.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Tom, “we’ll see if they’re highwaymen.
This is a nice quiet place to hold up
a car.”</p>

<p>But the men disappeared by jumping over a fence
that ran along the woods on the left. The automobile,
a man and a woman in it, dashed by the boys,
leaving a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>“So ho!” exclaimed Lanky, “our friends don’t
want to be seen! Suppose we make ourselves scarce
till they come back to the road.”</p>

<p>The boys hid in the woods, and presently the
three men reappeared on the road. Tom and Lanky
followed suit, and the march was resumed.</p>

<p>A mile more, and the men came to a crossroad.
They turned toward the west. When the
boys reached the crossroad Lanky stopped. “This
is a private lane,” he said. “See, it leads up to that
barn and stable. And there’s a big house. Our
friends are going in the back way.”</p>

<p>There was a screen of trees at the corner. The
boys went along the lane until the screen gave way
to a close-cropped hedge. Here they had a view of
a wide, velvety lawn and the large house, red-striped
awnings at the windows, on a gently-rising slope.</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed Tom. “Look there!”</p>

<p>There was no heed of his telling Lanky to look.
Lanky was staring at that part of the lawn that was
shielded by the trees at the corner. There was a
small, one-story house that looked as if it were made
of cardboard, a very picturesque building, brightly
painted to resemble cross-timbers, with two little
lattice windows. And grouped about the grass in
front of the house were a dozen or so men and
women, all of them dressed in fancy costumes, looking
as if they had just stepped out of a picture book
or down from the stage of a theatre.</p>

<p>“My eye!” said Tom. “What is it? A fancy
dress party?”</p>

<p>“Looks like a Robin Hood scene,” said Lanky.
“Some of them have bows and arrows. See that
girl in pink working that churn.” He watched
for a moment; then added, “So that’s why our
friends the highwaymen came along this way.”</p>

<p>“They don’t seem to have joined the crowd,”
said Tom. “Why didn’t they jump over the hedge?”</p>

<p>The people on the lawn were too busy to notice
the boys in the lane. Lanky nodded. “That’s so.
And it seems to me, Tom, that that crowd are a
different type from our three friends. These people
belong here; but I don’t think the others do.”</p>

<p>The boys looked up the lane. The three men had
entered at a gate that led to the rear of the big house.</p>

<p>“Let’s see what they’re doing,” said Tom.</p>

<p>Along the lane went the two boys, and turned in
at the gate.</p>

<p>The men had disappeared. Lanky shook his
head. “It’s queer, mighty queer. Of course those
fellows may belong here. But why should they
come all the way from that cove? And bring those
hats and cloaks with them?” He scratched his ear,
as he did when he was puzzled.</p>

<p>“Come along,” said Tom. “Nobody’ll throw
us out.”</p>

<p>They crossed the lawn to the steps of the porch.
A man came out from the front door, a man in
livery, apparently the butler. He held himself very
straight, he was an angular person, with a fishy eye.</p>

<p>“Yes?” he said; and though the word was a
short one he managed to express in it a cold sense
of disapproval.</p>

<p>“Er—” began Tom, “we would like to know
if three men, wearing brown cloaks and big slouch
hats, just came into this house.”</p>

<p>The butler shrugged his shoulders. “There are
gentlemen and ladies wearing every kind of costume
coming in and going out all the time,” he answered
stiffly.</p>

<p>That seemed to put an end to further questions;
but Lanky, after considering the matter for a moment,
inquired, “Whose place is this?”</p>

<p>“It belongs to Mr. Hastings,” said the butler,
eyeing the boys most disapprovingly. “He is not at
home at present. But I can answer any questions
for him.”</p>

<p>Neither Lanky nor Tom, however, could think
of any questions to ask. It seemed absurd to tell
this fishy-eyed servant that they had followed the
three men from the cove. And after all the men
might have a perfect right to have entered the house.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Tom, and turned on his heel,
followed by Lanky.</p>

<p>But when they were out in the lane again, Lanky
said, “I’m going to wait around here a little longer.
That servant’s a fool. Anybody could put anything
over on him.”</p>

<p>So they climbed up on the stone wall on the other
side of the lane and sat there like two sentries.</p>

<h1 id='t5132'>XIII—ON THE FISHING-SMACK</h1>

<p>When Tom and Lanky had turned to the right
and investigated the fishermen’s shanties that were
nearest to the marshes, David had turned to the left,
in the direction of the ocean. He had no particular
object in view, except to see what the man they had
met on the other bank of the cove was doing and
exchange a few more words with him, if the opportunity
offered.</p>

<p>He looked through the clutter of small, weatherbeaten
sheds without seeing the man, and came to
the beach on the ocean side. A short distance to the
south was a spit of sand, and there, seated on a log,
was the fellow with the straw hat.</p>

<p>David enjoyed an argument. He was not by
nature so curious about other people as Ben was,
but he liked to tease. So, with his hands stuck in
his pockets and a little swagger in his walk, he went
toward the man.</p>

<p>“Looking for a boat to come along and take
you for a sail?” he said. “It’s a long walk to town.”</p>

<p>“You’d better be on your way then,” the man
retorted. His tone was not very civil, and it made
David flush.</p>

<p>“I can look out for myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can, can you?” The man turned
round and glared at the young fellow. “Well, my
advice to you is to make yourself scarce pretty quick.”</p>

<p>David squared his shoulders. “You don’t want
me and my friends round here, do you? A person
might think you owned the beach.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the man, “I don’t want you round
here.” He looked at the boy fixedly for a minute.
“That’s plain enough, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s plain enough,” David admitted. “But
I don’t see that it’s any reason why we should go.”</p>

<p>“I’ve business here, and you haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Business? You don’t seem very busy.”</p>

<p>The man got up from the log and walked away,
down the beach toward a ledge of rock that shut off
the southern end.</p>

<p>What was the man’s business? David, rather
amused at the other’s surliness, followed after,
walking jauntily.</p>

<p>He climbed the ledge of rock. There was another
scallop of beach, with bushes close down to the sand.
The man was not in sight. But there was a small
fishing-smack at anchor not far from the shore, and
a dory was just pulling away from her.</p>

<p>David stepped down on the beach, and the first
thing he knew something had knocked him flat. He
lay sprawling on the sand, a heavy weight on his
back. Someone had caught his two hands and held
them like a vise.</p>

<p>“Holler if you want to,” said the man with the
straw hat.</p>

<p>David had no wish to shout. The breath was
knocked out of him.</p>

<p>The man pinned him down, and after kicking a
little, David decided the wisest course was to lie still.</p>

<p>After a few minutes there was a grating sound
on the sand. David twisted his head enough to see
that the dory had landed and that two men were
coming ashore.</p>

<p>“Hello, Sam, what you got there?” exclaimed
one of the strangers.</p>

<p>“A fresh guy, who wouldn’t mind his own
business,” was the answer. “Now I’m going to
teach him not to meddle:”</p>

<p>“Good for you, old sport! Give him a good
licking.”</p>

<p>“Pity we left the cat-o’-nine-tails out on the
boat,” said the second man.</p>

<p>“Three of them came to the cove,” said the man
on David’s back. “The other two went away; but
this fellow had to go nosing around into other
people’s business. I told him to make himself
scarce. But not he! Oh no, he had to find out
what I was doing. And now I’m going to take him
out on the boat and watch me do some fishing.”</p>

<p>There was a laugh at this. “You’ll let him bait
your hook, won’t you, Sam?” asked one.</p>

<p>“I’ll let him take the fish off,” Sam retorted.
“You fellows row us out, will you?”</p>

<p>The others agreed. The man on David’s back
eased his position. “Now,” said he, “you can come
along without any fuss or trouble, or you can come
with a black eye. Suit yourself; it doesn’t make
any difference to me.”</p>

<p>Three to one was greater odds than David cared
to tackle. “I’ll go along,” he grunted.</p>

<p>The man got up. David followed. Assuming a
care-free manner he walked to the boat and climbed
over the high side. A man sat at the oars, and Sam
and the two others took seats on the thwarts. The
oars dipped in the water, and the dory was rowed
out to the smack.</p>

<p>David and Sam went aboard, and the dory with
her crew of three rowed away again in the direction
of the cove.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Sam, “make yourself comfortable.
You’ve found out my business. I’m going to
fish for flounders.” And he walked aft and down
into the cabin.</p>

<p>David was puzzled. He could understand that
this man might have had a grudge against him, even
that he might have lost his temper and attacked him
as he had; but why should he carry a grudge so far
as to make him a prisoner on his fishing-boat?</p>

<p>He stared at the shore some time, then walked
up toward the bow. Sam had reappeared from the
cabin with fishing-tackle and was angling over the
side. There was a line for David, and so, there
being nothing better to do, David also set to fishing.</p>

<p>Fish were not biting on that particular afternoon,
however. Presently Sam hauled in his line. “The
pesky things never come when you want them,” he
said morosely. “I suppose there are lots of them
swimming around everywhere except where <span class='it'>I</span> cast
my hook.”</p>

<p>“You’re not a real fisherman,” said David.
“There’s a knack to catching fish.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not; and I don’t want to be,” was the
man’s answer. “Of all the stupid jobs, I think
fishing takes the cake.”</p>

<p>David was about to argue this point when another
man came out from the cabin and joined them. At
once David, wise in the look of sailormen from his
acquaintance with them on the docks of Barmouth,
decided that this was the skipper. The new arrival
stretched his arms and yawned prodigiously. “Golly,
I’m only half-awake yet,” he declared. “Sam,
where’d you pick up this fellow?”</p>

<p>“He wanted to have a look at the boat,” said
Sam. “In fact he was so set on having a look at
her that I just had to invite him aboard.”</p>

<p>He said this with a sly glance at David, but if he
had expected to get an angry denial he was disappointed,
for David, leaning his arms on the rail,
appeared to be in such a deep study of the shore as
to allow for no interruption.</p>

<p>“The others gone ashore?” asked the skipper,
evidently regarding the reason for David’s presence
on the boat as a matter of small importance.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sam. He pulled a large watch
from the upper pocket of his coat and looked at it.
“And it’s about time they were coming back.”</p>

<p>There was no sign of them, however; and the
sun began to slant toward the west, and then to dip
behind the trees, and still there was no boat to be seen
coming out from the cove. David, strolling up
and down the deck, noticed that Sam was becoming
impatient. After a while there was a fragrant odor
of cooking, and David, putting his head in at the
cabin door, saw that the skipper was getting supper
in the galley.</p>

<p>The sun had set when the skipper’s voice announced
that food was ready. “Come along,” Sam
said to David, and though the invitation was not
very cordial David went down to the cabin and ate
his fair share of the meal.</p>

<p>Afterwards the three, on deck, watched the shore
for a boat. And when the beach was quite dark
and Sam had looked at his watch a dozen times, he
said, almost angrily, “Well, Captain, I think it’s
about time to beat it. They must have changed
their plans. We don’t want to stay here all night.”</p>

<p>The skipper glanced at David. “How about
him?” he asked, with a jerk of the head.</p>

<p>“He can help you sail the boat down to Gosport.
That’ll pay for his supper.”</p>

<p>David was tired of inaction. To sail to Gosport
attracted him much more than staying here at anchor
any longer. He spoke up quickly:</p>

<p>“Yes, Captain. I know something about handling
sails.”</p>

<p>“Good enough. That’s more than Sam does,”
remarked the skipper. “He’s about as useful in
handling this boat as a belaying-pin.”</p>

<p>Shortly the anchor was up and the fishing-smack
under way. David carried out the skipper’s orders
with proper efficiency. With a gentle breeze the boat
stole southward along the shore, and in half-an-hour
the lights of the little settlement of Gosport were
glimmering over the water.</p>

<p>The smack came up to a wharf. “Now,” said
Sam to David, “you can go ashore if you like. The
captain and I may do a little cruising, but we don’t
need you any longer.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said David. He had a retort on the
tip of his tongue, but wisely forbore to utter it.
He jumped ashore. “If you come to Barmouth,
look me up,” he called back. “I’ll be glad to show
you the town.”</p>

<p>There was a laugh from the skipper, but none
from Sam. Immediately the fishing-smack pushed
out again.</p>

<p>Gosport was a small place, and David knew no
one there. He felt in his pocket, and found he had
no money to pay his fare to Barmouth. He walked
along the waterfront, considering what he should do,
and presently came upon a young man, who was
starting the engine of a small motor-boat.</p>

<p>“You’re not going anywhere in the neighborhood
of Camp Amoussock, are you?” David asked
the man in the boat.</p>

<p>The other looked around and surveyed the fellow
who had asked the question. “Are you one of the
boys from the camp?”</p>

<p>“I was there at dinner.” And in a few words
David told the story of what had happened to him
during the afternoon.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the man, “that’s a queer yarn. I
was just going out for a moonlight spin, and I
might as well go up to the camp as anywhere.
Jump aboard.”</p>

<p>David accepted with alacrity. The motor-boat
chugged out from the landing-stage, and leaving a
smooth silver ripple, darted north.</p>

<p>The owner of the motor-boat—he had told David
that his name was Henry Payson—said that,
although he had only been a month at Gosport, he
knew that part of the coast quite well, and had never
happened to see any fishermen in the cove that David
described. “That fellow Sam was a vindictive
chap,” he added musingly. “But you know, it
almost seems as if he had some other object than
merely showing his spitefulness when he took you
off in his boat.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought,” agreed David. “But
Tom and Lanky were still at the cove. He didn’t
lay hands on them.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Payson, “the cove’s around that
next point of land. No use stopping there now, I
suppose. Your friends will surely have gone back
to camp.”</p>

<p>When the motor-boat rounded the point, however,
Payson changed his mind. On shore there were a
score of lanterns; both banks of the cove fairly
bristled with them. “Hello,” exclaimed Payson,
“there’s something doing there all right!” And he
altered his course so as to bring his craft into the
mouth of the river.</p>

<p>As the boat ran up to the bridge boys came
down from both sides, apparently all the boys of
Camp Amoussock.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Dave!” cried John Tuckerman.
And immediately the two in the boat were the target
of a volley of questions.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried David. “Wait a minute.”
He swung himself out of the boat and up to
the bridge.</p>

<p>“Where are Lanky and Tom?” someone asked.</p>

<p>“Aren’t they here?” said David. And as
Tuckerman and Mr. Perkins and the boys from the
camp crowded around he told them briefly his adventures
since dinner.</p>

<p>“We’ve been hunting for you ever since
supper,” said Mr. Perkins. “I can’t imagine where
Larry and Tom can have gone.”</p>

<p>“Those three men rowed in here in the dory,”
said David. “Perhaps they carried Larry and Tom
off somewhere.”</p>

<p>“We’ve hunted through every shack,” said Bill
Crawford. “And we’ve been down the coast a
couple of miles.”</p>

<p>The chorus of voices explaining where they had
hunted started in again, interrupted by Mr. Perkins
giving the order to his troop to take the road back
to camp.</p>

<p>David thanked Henry Payson, and the motor-boat
chugged away. By the path along the shore the
searchers regained Camp Amoussock. And there
Mr. Perkins and John Tuckerman and David held
a council as to what to do next.</p>

<p>The upshot was that Mr. Perkins got out a small
car, and with Tuckerman and David set out to see
if they could learn any news of the missing boys.</p>

<h1 id='t5486'>XIV—BEN AT THE GABLES</h1>

<p>Ben that afternoon had a long, cool glass of
lemonade on the porch of the Gables while his friend
Roderick Fitzhugh introduced him to the men and
women who were sitting in wicker easy chairs. It
seemed to Ben that their names were somewhat
fantastic, but then so were their clothes, and the
names did appear to suit the costumes.</p>

<p>“This lady,” said Fitzhugh, nodding to a rosy-cheeked
girl, who wore her brown hair in two long
plaits down her back and whose dress was of primrose
yellow, “is the fair Maid Rosalind. She can
sing like a nightingale and dance like a wave of the
sea, and when she churns butter it comes out
pure gold.”</p>

<p>The girl stood up and made a curtsy. “Thanks,
kind Master Roderick,” she said. “But perhaps
your friend Master Ben doesn’t care for gold on
his bread.”</p>

<p>“The more fool he,” answered Fitzhugh.</p>

<p>“However, he can eat plumcake.” And Ben’s host
pushed a plate of delicious-looking cake toward
his guest.</p>

<p>“Yonder man in the high boots, with the fierce
mustaches,” Fitzhugh continued, “bears the high-sounding
name of Sir Marmaduke Midchester. He
looks like a sword swallower, but he is really as
gentle as a lamb. He has been known to eat crumbs
out of Maid Rosalind’s hand.”</p>

<p>“Glad to meet Master Sully,” said Sir Marmaduke.
“I wrote a song this morning—words and
music both—perhaps he would like to hear me
sing it.”</p>

<p>Fitzhugh held up his hand. “Not just now,
Marmaduke, please. Let my guest digest his plumcake
in quiet.”</p>

<p>So the introductions went on, with all sorts of
jokes and banter. It was a jolly crowd, and Ben was
enjoying it hugely. He began to find his tongue and
make retorts of his own. But when he had finished
the lemonade and the cake he turned to his host.
“I’d like to stay, but I think I had better
be getting back,” he said. “I’ve got to go out to
Cotterell’s Island.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Master Ben. If you’d like to stay, you
shall stay. Cotterell’s Island can wait. We need
you here at present.”</p>

<p>“Well, but——” began Ben.</p>

<p>“There are no ‘buts’ about it,” answered
Fitzhugh. “List to me, my lad. This place is a
green oasis in a desert of modern things. Here we
do as we please. And it pleases us now to be ladies
and gentlemen of good Sherwood Forest and
Nottingham.” Fitzhugh stood up. “Come with me.
I’ll find you more fitting clothes than those simple
togs you have on.”</p>

<p>Ben grinned. He was fond of dressing up and
had often acted in school theatricals in Barmouth.
He didn’t know what Fitzhugh and his friends were
planning, but he thought he would like to take part
in the game. After all, his car would take him
quickly back to town and he could paddle out to the
island by moonlight, if necessary. So he followed
Fitzhugh indoors and up a wide staircase to the
second floor.</p>

<p>When he came down again he wore brown doublet
and hose, with a brown cloak slung from his
shoulders and a broad-brimmed brown hat on his head.
There was a chorus of approval from the group on
the porch.</p>

<p>“Master Ben, apprentice to an armorer,”
Fitzhugh introduced him. “And now, my lads and
lasses, let us hie us out to the greenwood tree.”</p>

<p>There was nothing formal about Roderick
Fitzhugh’s friends. The crowd had hardly more
than descended the steps of the porch when the girl
called Maid Rosalind and the man called Sir
Marmaduke Midchester each took one of Ben’s hands
and raced across the lawn. Luckily Ben had pulled
his broad-brimmed hat on tight. His cloak flew
back from his shoulders. And he heard shouts and
laughs from the rest of the party as they followed
pell mell.</p>

<p>The lawn of the Gables was wide and gently
sloping. When Rosalind and Sir Marmaduke
finally slackened speed Ben found they had come to
a corner where poplars and spruces made a background
against a road. One oak tree stood out by
itself, and there was a small house with picturesque
criss-crossed windows and a door with big
curved hinges.</p>

<p>“There,” said Sir Marmaduke, “behold the
Forest of Sherwood! There aren’t so many trees,
but each of them is a giant.”</p>

<p>Rosalind flung herself down near the oak. “Oh,
Master Ben,” she panted, “fan me with your hat.”</p>

<p>And while Ben gallantly flapped his hat close to
the red-cheeked lady, the others came bounding into
the glade, like so many children just let out
from school.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Fitzhugh, a paper in his hand,
was calling out directions. Ben, observing everything,
saw a couple of men crossing the lawn with
what looked like a big camera. He turned to
Rosalind. “I know what it is,” he whispered.
“You’re moving-picture people doing a play.”</p>

<p>“Good for you,” she answered. She nodded
toward Fitzhugh. “He wrote the plot, and we’ve
been dressing up and doing it every day this week.”</p>

<p>The play began, and went on for an hour or
so, with frequent interruptions. Some scenes were
done over and over again before Fitzhugh was satisfied
with them. He found a part for Ben, and instructed
him carefully how to act before the camera.
And whenever the company got tired the cameramen
turned off their machine, and the actors lounged on
the greensward while somebody sang or did a
fancy dance.</p>

<p>It was great sport, and Ben was surprised when,
glancing toward the west, he saw that the sun had
set behind the trees.</p>

<p>“I must be going,” he said to Fitzhugh. “I’ve
had a splendid time.”</p>

<p>Fitzhugh waved his hand at the cameramen.
“That’s enough for to-day. We always end with a
woodland dance, Ben, and then, back to the house
for dinner.”</p>

<p>“I can’t stay to dinner,” began Ben; but before
he could say more Rosalind and another girl had
each caught a hand of his and the whole company had
spread out in a ring. Rosalind started to sing, and
all the others took up the song. There followed a
dance, in which Ben did his share, and then the
crowd formed into a line, each with his hands on
the shoulders of the one in front, and led by Fitzhugh
they wound across the wide lawn and back to
the Gables.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Ben to his host, when they arrived
on the porch, “I’ll get into my own clothes and dash
back to Barmouth.”</p>

<p>“What? Without dinner? I can’t let you go
hungry.” Fitzhugh turned to a servant. “Show
this gentleman up to the yellow guestroom and get
him whatever he wants.”</p>

<p>It was difficult to argue with such a positive man
as that; and moreover Ben was thoroughly enjoying
his adventure. To be shown up to the yellow guestroom,
and later to dine with such a company of
moving-picture people would be a new and delightful
experience. He would have a story to tell Tom and
David and John Tuckerman when he got back to the
island that would make them open their eyes. So
Ben followed the servant into the house, where the
lamps were already lighted.</p>

<p>There was a gallery on the second floor, with
ever so many rooms opening from it. The servant
went to a door and turned the knob. “This is the
yellow room, sir. You’ll find clean towels in the
bathroom. If you want anything, there’s an electric
push button.”</p>

<p>Ben went in and shut the door. He had never
seen a more luxuriously furnished bedroom. He
switched on an electric light and a little orange-shaded
lamp on a table shone forth. He threw his
hat on the bureau and rolled up the sleeves of
his doublet.</p>

<p>The door of a bathroom stood open. He went
in, turned on the water, and washed his face and
hands. As he was drying them with a towel he
walked over to a window. Looking out, he saw a
garage and a circular driveway. Beyond that was a
lane that led back of a big barn. And on the stone
wall on the opposite side of the lane two boys
were sitting.</p>

<p>Ben stopped using the towel, and stared. The
two boys looked surprisingly like Tom and Lanky
Larry. They were at some distance from the house
and the shadow of the barn fell across the stone
wall. But they did look like Tom and Lanky. However,
it was inconceivable that those two should be
sitting there. He must be mistaken. For what
could possibly have brought those two to the neighborhood
of the Gables? And why should they perch
on a stone wall as if they had nothing to do?</p>

<p>Ben turned to go back to the yellow room; but in
the doorway he stopped. Someone was there, at the
bureau, a man in a brown hat and cloak. He had
pulled a bureau drawer out and was looking in it.
Some one of the guests must have mistaken this room
for his own.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Ben, “I didn’t know there was
anyone here.”</p>

<p>The man looked over his shoulder. “My mistake,”
he said. “I thought this was my room. I
beg your pardon. My room is next door.”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder you didn’t know the right one,”
Ben said politely. “I never saw a house with so
many rooms. I say, in that cloak and hat you look
very much like me in my costume. I don’t remember
seeing you in the moving-pictures.”</p>

<p>“I changed my things,” muttered the man.
“Sometimes I wear one set and other times another.”
He walked to the door, opened it, and went down
the hall.</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” said Ben, half-aloud. “He
keeps his hat on in the house. I suppose he thinks,
because it’s part of his costume, it’s a perfectly
proper thing to do.”</p>

<p>Before the mirror at the bureau Ben put on his
own broad-brimmed hat, turned on the light at a
wall-bracket, and surveyed himself in the glass.</p>

<p>“The hat does help to make a fellow look different,”
he said to himself. “I guess I’ll keep mine
on when I go downstairs; though I don’t suppose it
would be the right thing to wear a hat to dinner.”</p>

<p>He switched off both the lights and went out into
the hall. The gallery and the lower floor of the big
house appeared to be empty; he supposed the guests
had all gone to make ready for dinner. He walked
around the gallery to the staircase. The afterglow
of sunset partly lighted the lower floor, and here and
there soft lamps shed circles of radiance, but
for the most part the house was pleasantly
shadowy, which made its fine furnishings all the
more interesting.</p>

<p>Ben went down the stairs and stopped in the
large hall to look at a grandfather’s clock that stood
opposite the front door. Above the dial was a painted
ship that sailed on a deep-blue sea. He was admiring
the ship when somewhere in the upper part of the
house someone gave a scream.</p>

<p>Ben waited a moment. There was another shout.
Doors on the gallery opened. He heard people calling
“What’s the matter?” There was confusion above-stairs.
Someone shouted “Lock the doors! Don’t
let him get away!”</p>

<p>The front door was open. Ben dashed across the
polished floor to shut it.</p>

<p>His hand was on the knob when someone caught
him from behind. A rug slipped under his feet and
he came down hard on the floor.</p>

<p>Someone had fallen on top of him, someone had
tackled him tight about the knees, a regular football
tackle.</p>

<p>There was a babel of voices. Someone shouted,
“We’ve got him all right!”</p>

<p>Ben tried to speak, to explain. “Hold on there!”
he grunted.</p>

<p>But someone else was explaining. He heard
someone say, “We heard the yells, and we came
in at the side door, and we saw this fellow dashing
for the front door.”</p>

<p>Then Ben heard Fitzhugh’s voice. “Well, he
won’t get away now,” Fitzhugh said. “Suppose you
let him up.”</p>

<p>The fellow who had made the tackle released
Ben’s knees and Ben turned around and sat up.</p>

<p>“My eye! If it isn’t Ben Sully!”</p>

<p>Ben saw Tom and Lanky Larry staring at him
in wide-eyed wonder.</p>

<p>“Of course it is, Tom, you goat!” Ben responded.
“Who did you think it was?”</p>

<p>“We thought you were one of the men we
tracked here from the cove,” said Tom. “They
wore cloaks and hats like yours; and you did look
as if you were trying to escape.”</p>

<p>“I was going to lock the front door,” said Ben,
getting to his feet. “What’s the trouble anyhow,
Mr. Fitzhugh?”</p>

<p>“Two of the ladies found things missing from
their rooms—jewels,” explained Fitzhugh. “And
one of the men saw a fellow sneaking down a passage.”
He turned to Tom and Lanky. “I don’t
know who you two are, but Ben seems to, so that’s
all right. Let’s see if we can find the thief.”</p>

<p>Immediately everyone was busy. Some went outdoors,
some hunted through the house. The Gables
blazed with light; the garage and the other outbuildings
were thoroughly searched. But no thief
was found, and half-an-hour later the whole company
met on the porch to talk over the matter.</p>

<p>Tom and Lanky by turns told their tale, how they
had seen the three men at the cove put on cloaks
and hats and how they had followed the men to the
Gables. The butler, looking rather sheepish, admitted
that the boys had spoken to him about the
strangers and that he had not thought their story
merited his attention. Then Tom said that he and
Lanky had sat on the stone wall until they heard
shouts in the house, and had then run in at a side
door, and in the hall had seen a fellow dressed just
like the three they had followed apparently making
his escape. “We didn’t know Ben was anywhere
near here,” he added; “and anyway we wouldn’t
have recognized him in that blooming hat.”</p>

<p>Ben told about his finding the stranger, dressed
like himself, hunting through the bureau drawer in
the yellow room. The guests who had missed their
jewels and the man who had seen someone stealing
along a passage repeated their stories. “Well,”
said Fitzhugh, when they had all finished, “you
remember we couldn’t find some of the things we left
in the playhouse the other day. I believe these
fellows took them, and thought they could pass
themselves off as some of my guests and ransack
all the rooms in the house.”</p>

<p>“They did it,” said Marmaduke Midchester.
“And they must have got away by one of the back
doors while we were all here at the front.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose they’ve gone back to the
cove?” asked Lanky. “They might have. They
didn’t know we were following them.”</p>

<p>“That’s an idea,” agreed Fitzhugh. He spoke
to the butler, and in a few minutes the chauffeur
and two other men were receiving instructions to
take the car and drive to the cove, look for the men,
and if they were not to be found there to drive
on to Barmouth and report the thefts to the police.</p>

<p>“And now, my friends,” Fitzhugh added to his
guests, “let us have dinner. Master Ben’s two pals
must need sustenance after their long tramp. Come,
the soup will be getting cold.”</p>

<p>They were still at the dinner table when a motor
horn sounded outside. Everyone ran to the door.
It was not Fitzhugh’s car, however, but a much
smaller one. From it descended David, John
Tuckerman and Mr. Perkins.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare,” exclaimed Tuckerman, “here’s
Tom and Larry! And that fellow in doublet and
hose—why, I do believe that’s Benjamin Sully!”</p>

<h1 id='t5885'>XV—VARIOUS CLUES</h1>

<p>John Tuckerman and David and Mr. Perkins
went up on the porch, where Ben introduced them to
Roderick Fitzhugh. Fitzhugh, after shaking hands
cordially with each of them, bowed toward his house-guests.
“My friends,” said he, “we have the pleasure
of welcoming the worthy Chief Counsellor of
Camp Amoussock, and Mr. Tuckerman, who is the
owner of famous Cotterell Hall on Cotterell’s Island
in the harbor of Barmouth, and Mr. David Norton—, er,
Ben, what is the best way to describe your good-looking
friend?”</p>

<p>“The best batter in New England,” piped up
Lanky Larry. “I ought to know. He knocked me
out of the box.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Fitzhugh in his amusingly
formal manner. “Mr. David Norton, the famous
Yankee slugger.” He turned to the three new
arrivals. “Gentlemen, let me present you to my
friends,” and he called out the names, beginning
with Maid Rosalind and the other ladies and ending
with Sir Marmaduke Midchester.</p>

<p>Tuckerman laughed. “I’d no idea Ben mixed
in such high-sounding company. What is he?—Sir
Marmaduke’s squire?”</p>

<p>“He’s the apprentice to an armorer,” said
Fitzhugh. “Incidentally he was mistaken this evening
for a robber.”</p>

<p>Then Fitzhugh told the story of the robbery,
including the adventure of Tom and Larry with the
men from the cove.</p>

<p>“Those men must be the three that belonged to
the fishing-smack,” said David. “I thought there
was something crooked going on. That’s it—they’re
a gang of thieves.”</p>

<p>David related his adventure, and then Mr.
Perkins told how he and Tuckerman and the boys
from the camp hunted for the three missing fellows.
“We drove in here on the chance that you might
know something about them,” he said to Fitzhugh.
“We came straight up the road from the cove, but
we didn’t see any men answering the description of
the thieves.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Fitzhugh, “we’ll get the police on
their track, and I’ll telephone down to Gosport to
have the people there keep an eye out for that fishing-boat.
And now won’t you come in and let me offer
you some refreshments? Master Ben will want
to change his clothes before he sets out in
his racing-car.”</p>

<p>While the others were in the dining-room Ben
exchanged his doublet and hose for his everyday
garb. Then he went to the garage and got out the
little car he had borrowed from his uncle in
Barmouth. It clattered up to the front door and
a few minutes later Fitzhugh was saying good-night
to Tuckerman, Perkins and the boys.</p>

<p>David got into Ben’s car. The car from Camp
Amoussock moved off along the driveway. Roderick
Fitzhugh came up to Ben, who was starting his
engine. “I regret that Mr. Joseph Hastings wasn’t
at home,” he said, “so that you could have learned
whether he did lose a silver snuff-box on Cotterell’s
Island. I’ll ask him when I see him.”</p>

<p>Ben grinned. “I’d almost forgotten about the
snuff-box,” he answered, “but I think you’ll find
when you ask Mr. Hastings that he did lose it there.”</p>

<p>“You’re a bright fellow, Master Sully.”</p>

<p>Fitzhugh gave a wink. “Don’t tell all you know.
And if you’re in the neighborhood any time come
in and see Joseph Hastings.”</p>

<p>The little car rattled away, following the tail-light
of the other automobile.</p>

<p>“Who is that man?” asked David, as they turned
into the highroad.</p>

<p>“Do you mean Mr. Roderick Fitzhugh?” inquired
Ben innocently.</p>

<p>“Chuck it, Benjie. That isn’t his real name.”</p>

<p>“Why isn’t it, smartie?”</p>

<p>“Roderick Fitzhugh! Marmaduke Midchester!”
David repeated the names of some of the other people
he had met at the Gables. “Stuff and nonsense,
Benjie! They made them up.”</p>

<p>Ben said nothing, and after a few minutes David
began again.</p>

<p>“Where’d they get those clothes?”</p>

<p>“Where do people usually get their clothes?
Tailors and dressmakers made them, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“What are they? A crowd of actors?”</p>

<p>Ben smiled. “They’re not professional actors.
They’re doing a play that Mr. Fitzhugh wrote for
the moving-pictures, and they like their costumes so
much they keep them on most of the time. I’m in the
pictures,” he added in a tone of pride.</p>

<p>The car clattered loudly over a rough stretch of
road. Then David resumed his questions. “How in
thunder did you happen to get mixed up with them?”</p>

<p>“I was driving along this morning and I met
Mr. Fitzhugh and he suggested that we go on a
hunt for hooked-rugs.”</p>

<p>“Hooked-rugs!” exploded David.</p>

<p>“Yes. They don’t grow on trees. They’re to
be found in the cottages around here. We caught
some fine specimens.”</p>

<p>David put his hand on Ben’s knee. “It was time
we rescued you from that fellow, my boy,” he said.
“I don’t know anything about hooked-rugs, but I
think your Mr. Fitzhugh has bats in his belfry.”</p>

<p>The car driven by Mr. Perkins had stopped, and
Ben brought his own noisy equipage to a standstill
at the side of the road. “We’re going to have another
look at the cove,” said Tuckerman. “We
can’t drive in through the woods.”</p>

<p>But the cove, when they reached it by the path
through the woods, was as deserted as it had been
when the boys from Camp Amoussock explored it
earlier in the evening. Lanky and Tom pointed out
the dory, still beached on the shingle, in which the
three men had come ashore, and the shack in which
they had kept the costumes. “I think the dory is
pretty good proof that they didn’t come back here,”
said Tom. “I guess they must have made off toward
Gosport, to join the fishing-smack somewhere in
that neighborhood.”</p>

<p>They returned to the two cars and drove on to
Camp Amoussock. There Tom and John Tuckerman
embarked in the <span class='it'>Argo</span> to sail back to Cotterell’s
Island, while Ben and David continued their clattering
ride to Barmouth.</p>

<p>At Barmouth, Ben restored the car to his uncle,
and the two boys went down to the harbor and
launched the canoe. Over the placid water they
paddled easily, for they were old hands at handling
a canoe together. And presently they landed at the
island, and found the other two sitting on the pier.</p>

<p>There was much to talk over, and none of them
were sleepy. They sat on the bank above the beach
and swapped adventures. “I’ve been wondering,”
said Tom, “whether there was any connection between
the men who stole those things at Mr.
Fitzhugh’s house and the men I saw here on the
island last night.”</p>

<p>“And the gigantic footprints,” said David.
“I’ve been thinking about that, too. But how would
you explain the lady’s handkerchief, with the initials
A. S. L.?”</p>

<p>They argued about that for some time before they
went to bed. Ben, however, took little part in the
discussion. He was trying to find a reason for the
discovery of the silver snuff-box that Joseph
Hastings had bought in Barmouth in the chest hidden
in the cliff.</p>

<p>Next morning Ben went with Tuckerman to
Cotterell Hall. “What do you make of it, Ben?”
said Tuckerman. “We don’t seem to be any nearer
to finding the treasure than we were when we first
came here. I know you’ve got some theory in that
wise head of yours.”</p>

<p>Ben walked up and down the living-room.
“Well,” he answered slowly, “I think somebody
has mixed up the trails. Let’s see how the matter
stands. We know that your Uncle Christopher
thought there was a secret. We found that out from
the note in the frame of the picture.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Christopher knew there was a secret,”
agreed Tuckerman. “I think that’s very clear.”</p>

<p>Ben nodded. “What did we find next? Those
jottings your uncle made in his notebook.” Ben
stopped at the secretary, took out the notebook,
turned to the marked page, and read aloud. “‘As
regards the saying that the hiding-place is just
beyond the three pines that stand between two rocks
where the sun goes down, I have scoured and scoured
the island, and come to the opinion that the extreme
southwestern point must be the place intended,
although to-day there are only two pines there. I
have dug at this place, but found only sand.’ That’s
what your uncle wrote. But he didn’t find the treasure
at the southwestern point.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman smiled. “So far so good.”</p>

<p>Ben ran his eye down the page. “Now we come
to this. ‘Find the mahogany-hued man with the
long, skinny legs and look in his breast pocket. That’s
a saying my father handed down. What can it
mean?’ Well, it seems to me that’s where the trails
begin to get mixed.”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought we decided that referred to
the mahogany secretary,” said Tuckerman.</p>

<p>“So we did,” answered Ben. “But were we
right? Let’s see. We looked in the secretary and
found a piece of parchment with half a message on it.
We couldn’t make out much from that. Then I read
this in the notebook.” He turned again to the page,
“‘I’ve heard that the old clipper ship got some of
the cargo that the mahogany man carried. But if
she did, what use is that to us now? She sailed out
of Barmouth Harbor during the Revolution.’”</p>

<p>“I’ve always thought you were mighty clever in
finding that model of the clipper ship up in the
attic,” said Tuckerman.</p>

<p>“Well,” agreed Ben, “I’m not denying that I
was pretty well pleased with that myself. But what
did we learn? That James Sampson took a box to
the north cliff, meaning to put it on a boat, but found
that there were some people off shore in another boat
and so hid the box in the rocks, and that the rocks
were marked like a cross. Very good. We found
the place and we found a box there. But there wasn’t
anything very valuable in the box when we found it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Tuckerman assented. “But I don’t
see any other clue to the treasure.”</p>

<p>Ben was staring through the window at the trees
glistening in the sunlight. “I think that box was
hidden in the cliff since we’ve been on the island,”
he said reflectively, “and I don’t believe that any of
the things in it ever came from Cotterell Hall.”</p>

<p>“You don’t!” exclaimed Tuckerman.</p>

<p>“And that means,” continued Ben, who was following
the line of his own thoughts, “that somebody
was trying to set us on a wrong trail by hiding those
two pieces of parchment in this house.”</p>

<p>“But what object would anyone have in doing
that?” Tuckerman asked. “I can’t see any good
reason for their taking so much trouble.” He considered
this idea for several minutes, while Ben
continued his study of the trees and the glimpse
of blue water that was to be seen from the window.</p>

<p>“And we thought we’d kept the problem of the
Cotterell treasure pretty much a secret,” Tuckerman
said presently.</p>

<p>“Gigantic footprints, lady’s handkerchief, men
prowling about the house in the dark.” Ben chuckled
softly. “That doesn’t look as if we had the island
much to ourselves, does it?”</p>

<p>“No,” Tuckerman admitted. “We haven’t kept
up the Cotterell tradition for exclusiveness.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ben, “if somebody has been trying
to set us on a wrong trail, the question is was it the
giant, the lady, or the night-prowlers? Or did the
three belong to one party.”</p>

<p>“The lady is a stumbling-block,” nodded
Tuckerman.</p>

<p>“If there were two parties,” said Ben, turning
around, “my own opinion is that it’s the giant and
the lady who’ve been making game of us.”</p>

<p>“Benjamin, what are you driving at?”</p>

<p>For answer Ben laughed. “Never mind, Professor.
If I should tell you what’s in my mind, and
it shouldn’t prove to be true, think how flat I’d feel.
And now I think it’s time we went back to camp if
we’re going in swimming before dinner.”</p>

<p>Just before sunset that afternoon the chug of a
motor-boat broke the stillness of the water around
the island. The boat stole up to the landing-stage
and two men got out. They went up the walk toward
Cotterell Hall. “A beautiful mansion, Marmaduke,”
said the man in the white flannel suit to the one in
brown jacket and knickerbockers.</p>

<p>“I agree with you, Roderick,” said the other.
“I suppose you would like to pick it up and carry it
off to the Gables.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. But what is to prevent us from
making use of it here? Sir Peter Cotterell defying
the people of Barmouth.” Roderick Fitzhugh pointed
in this direction and that, talking eagerly, until his
companion interrupted him with a whispered,
“They’re coming up in their sailboat.”</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Argo</span> touched the landing-stage, and
Fitzhugh and his friend went out on the pier.
“Hello, lads,” cried Fitzhugh. “We came out to
take a look at the famous island Ben told us about.”</p>

<p>“Did you learn anything about the thieves?”
Tom called from the <span class='it'>Argo</span>.</p>

<p>“No, not yet. But we’ve got the local police
scouring the country. I don’t expect much from
them,” added Fitzhugh. “What I hope is that the
rascals will make us another call.”</p>

<p>“We’ve been fishing,” said Ben. “Hope you’ll
stay to supper.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Fitzhugh, “I’ve got my guests at
the Gables.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t take any excuse from me yesterday,”
Ben retorted. “Turn about’s fair play.
You’ve never tasted Dave’s fried flounder.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, we haven’t,” said Marmaduke
Midchester. “I vote to stay.”</p>

<p>They had supper on the beach, and afterwards
Ben urged Midchester to sing the song he had written.</p>

<p>“Oh, Master Ben,” Fitzhugh protested, “why
break in on the evening calm?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Tom. “We’d all like some
music.”</p>

<p>“Music?” echoed Fitzhugh. “Who said anything
about music? Well, if you’re determined to
have him commit the crime, on your own heads
be it!”</p>

<p>Midchester, who was a big man, stood up and
sang in a deep bass, a song about a knight who loved
a lady but who rode off to the wars. It had a spirited
chorus, with many gestures, such as drawing a sword,
waving a hand, and shaking a knight’s banner. By
the time that Midchester sang the second chorus all
the others were up, singing loudly and imitating his
motions. It ended in a final loud cheer that could be
heard at least a mile away.</p>

<p>“That’s better than I expected,” said Fitzhugh.
“See, it scared the geese.”</p>

<p>He pointed to the western sky, across which a
distant triangle of wild geese were flying.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Tuckerman, “I will give you a song
of the sea as sung in the prairie schooners of
the west.”</p>

<p>He had a good voice, and his song was so popular
that he had to give an encore. Afterwards
Fitzhugh said that he must take Midchester away or
he would break out again.</p>

<p>Good-nights were exchanged on the pier and the
motor-boat headed south.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tuckerman, “they’re a good pair
of scouts. I don’t suppose this island has heard so
much noise since old Sir Peter’s day. I like guests
myself. And as there doesn’t seem any likelihood of
finding the Cotterell treasure, I don’t see why we
shouldn’t keep open house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we haven’t given up hope of finding it,
have we?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Benjie hasn’t,” said David.</p>

<p>They all looked at the black-haired boy.</p>

<p>“Why, of course, I haven’t,” he answered calmly.
“And the more people who come out here to look for
it, the more chance we have of finding it, I think.
You don’t suppose Fitzhugh and Midchester came
here just to see us, do you?”</p>

<p>“I bet they did,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“I bet they didn’t,” said Ben. “They took us
in as a side-show on their way to the big tent.”</p>

<h1 id='t6309'>XVI—THE CAMPERS CALL AT BARMOUTH</h1>

<p>The <span class='it'>Argo</span> was scudding along in a good breeze
to Barmouth. Ben was carving a small piece of
wood into what he fancied was a resemblance to a
mermaid. David, his hands clasped behind his head,
lounged in a comfortable corner. Tuckerman was at
the tiller, and Tom surveyed his pupil through
approving eyes.</p>

<p>“Professor, I think we’re ready to give you
your diploma,” Tom said, as he noticed the easy
manner in which Tuckerman handled the sailboat.
“You’re an able seaman. I’ll give you an honor
mark as a navigator.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll pass you as a first-rate cook,” said
David, turning and nodding his head. “You fried
those eggs this morning just as well as I could have,
and praise can’t be higher than that.”</p>

<p>“You coax the fish right out of the sea,” said
Ben, looking up from his carving. “There was a
time when I didn’t believe you’d ever learn to
bait a hook so the fish couldn’t nibble it off; but
you can do it now. I’ll graduate you as a competent
fisherman.”</p>

<p>“And my swimming?” asked Tuckerman, his
eye on the water curling over the bow.</p>

<p>“Well, as to that,” said David, “you’re not exactly
a merman, but you can paddle along at a decent
pace. Yes, we’ll call you a swimmer. I should
say you were a pretty good all-around fellow
now, Professor.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman looked pleased. Praise from these
three boys was very satisfying. And he knew that
what they said was not mere idle banter. He had
learned a great deal since he had been camping
with them.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” he said. “To be able to sail a boat,
to cook, to fish, to swim—why, that’s more than I
ever expected to learn when I came here from the
west. I tell you what! It was a great thing for me
when I decided to take a look at my Uncle
Christopher’s island.”</p>

<p>“And what are you going to do with it now
that you’ve seen it?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I’ve got to go back to my home.
I don’t suppose anyone would want to live way out in
the harbor nowadays. There’s not enough to do
there. But I hate to take all those fine old furnishings
out of the house. They belong there, and they
don’t belong anywhere else.”</p>

<p>“There’s an old house out on the Boston road,”
said Ben, “that the owner keeps up as a sort of a
museum. He has all the old furniture that was used
in colonial days. There’s a great deal of travel on
that road in summer, and he charges a quarter for
every person that goes over the house. There’s a
care-taker, of course. I think she serves tea for a
quarter extra.”</p>

<p>“That’s an idea,” said Tuckerman. “Only my
house isn’t on a main road. It’s a rather hard place
to reach.”</p>

<p>“All the better,” put in Tom. “People like
excursions. We could put up signs in Barmouth and
all along the road. ‘Be sure to take the boat to
famous Cotterell Hall on Cotterell’s Island and hunt
for the treasure!’ That would get them all right.
You could charge as much as you like.”</p>

<p>“And Tom could run a ferry, and Ben be the
care-taker and serve ginger-ale at a dollar a glass,”
suggested David.</p>

<p>“And you could cork your face and be the
famous mahogany man from the Barbadoes,” retorted
Ben. “He’s a wonder in a minstrel
show, Professor.”</p>

<p>“It sounds good,” Tuckerman agreed. “It’s
certainly up-to-date. But somehow I don’t feel that
it’s quite dignified enough for Cotterell Hall.”</p>

<p>“You can make it dignified enough,” said Tom,
“by charging enormous prices.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman laughed. “You’re right. You fellows
are Yankees sure enough. You make me feel
like a greenhorn.”</p>

<p>“And think of the business it would bring to
Barmouth,” said Ben, putting the attempt at a mermaid
into his pocket and sitting up straight. “People
who went to the island would probably have to spend
the night at the hotel. Why, you ought to be
able to make a deal with the proprietor to share
his profits.”</p>

<p>“Ben’s started now,” exclaimed David. “Stop
him somebody quick, or he’ll be spending the money
we’re making from the concern.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s a great idea,” Ben proceeded, as
usual paying no attention to David’s jibe. “It’ll put
Barmouth on the map. ‘Cotterell Hall, the most
famous treasure house on the Atlantic Coast!’”</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t use that word ‘treasure,’”
Tom protested. “It has a hoodoo sound.”</p>

<p>“And speaking of putting things on the map,”
said Tuckerman, “here’s the wharf ahead. Don’t get
me all excited while I bring her up to the dock.”</p>

<p>The <span class='it'>Argo</span> made a perfect landing. “Good
enough,” said Tom. “That couldn’t have been done
better. Professor, you’re a dandy.”</p>

<p>They went up the main street and turned off to
the elm-shaded lane where the Halletts lived. They
were going to call on Milly Hallett.</p>

<p>Milly was at home. She was, in fact, enjoying
an afternoon nap in the Nantucket hammock on the
side porch when Tom spied her from the lane.</p>

<p>The sound of footsteps woke her, and seeing
who was coming in at the gate she swung her feet
down from the hammock, smoothed her rumpled
skirt, and patted her fluffy hair. And because she
still felt a trifle piqued that Tom was having all the
fun of camping on Cotterell’s Island, she decided
on the spur of the moment to be a little standoffish
with the callers.</p>

<p>“Hello, Milly,” said her brother, in the offhand
way brothers have, “we thought we’d come over to
see how you were getting along.”</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Mr. Tuckerman,” said Milly,
standing up and giving that gentleman the tips of her
fingers. “I hope the boys are looking after you all
right on your island.”</p>

<p>“I can’t complain,” smiled Tuckerman. “We do
as well as we can, without any ladies to help us.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you sit down?” Milly invited politely.</p>

<p>Tuckerman took a chair, and the three boys, impressed
in spite of themselves by Milly’s society manner,
perched on the rail of the porch.</p>

<p>“We were wondering,” said Tuckerman,
“whether we could induce you to come out to supper
on the island. We hoped the simplicity of the meal
would be atoned for by the beauty of the scenery.
I can promise you a fine sunset.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for the invitation.” Milly swung
gently back and forth. “Let me see—what did I
have on hand for this evening?”</p>

<p>“Oh, chuck it, Milly!” said Tom. “Of course
you want to come along.”</p>

<p>“I remember now,” said Milly suavely. “I have
a date with my friend Sarah Hooper. There’s a new
movie in town.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course,” said Tuckerman in a regretful
tone, “we can’t compete with a new moving-picture
show.”</p>

<p>Milly smiled. “The boys are still giving you
plenty of good food, are they? And keeping
you amused?”</p>

<p>David moved impatiently on his perch. “The
Professor never got better food anywhere. He says
so himself.”</p>

<p>“I thought perhaps the menu might get a little
tiresome,” Milly suggested sweetly. “Boys are so
apt to stick to one or two of the same things when
they have to cook for themselves.”</p>

<p>“We don’t,” grunted David.</p>

<p>“She knows we don’t,” said Tom. “I say, Milly,
what’s your game?”</p>

<p>“Game?” Milly wrinkled her pretty nose. “I
don’t know what you mean!” She glanced again
at Tuckerman. “Boys are funny creatures,
aren’t they?”</p>

<p>The boys came down from the rail with one
accord. Indignant replies were on the tongues of
each; but Milly pointed beyond them at the lane.
“Here comes Sarah Hooper now,” she said. “It’s
just possible I can get her to change our date.”</p>

<p>Up the path came the black-eyed girl, a yellow
sweater on her arm. “Hello, everybody!” she sang
out, as she reached the porch. “What is it? An
experience meeting?”</p>

<p>“They want me to go to supper with them on
Mr. Tuckerman’s island,” said Milly. “I told them
I had a date with you.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Miss Sarah Hooper will join the
party,” Tuckerman added promptly. “We’d like
her to.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” exclaimed Sarah. “I don’t know why
I shouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Milly said,” put in Tom, “that you and she
were going to a new movie.”</p>

<p>A glance passed from Sarah to Milly, and Sarah
nodded her head. “That’s so,” she agreed. “I do
remember we were.”</p>

<p>“However,” said Milly, “if Sally would really
like to accept your invitation, we can go to the movies
some other time.”</p>

<p>There was a pause, for Sarah was not sure what
her friend wanted her to say; and then Ben broke
the silence by pounding the porch-rail with his fist.
“By jiminy, girls are funny creatures, aren’t they?
They’re crazy to come, but they don’t want to
admit it.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” began Milly. But Tuckerman interposed.</p>

<p>“The funnier people are, the pleasanter it is to
be with them. We do need the company of ladies on
our island. We’ve only been seeing each other, and
sandpipers and gulls. It would be doing us a great
favor if these two ladies would come and freshen
us up.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sarah, charmed by this gallant
speech, “I’d be glad to come. It’ll be a perfect
evening.”</p>

<p>Milly got up from the hammock. “I’ll contribute
a box of fudge.”</p>

<p>“That’s all that’s needed to make it complete,”
said Tuckerman.</p>

<p>The girls went indoors, Milly to tell her mother
about the party, and Sarah to telephone to her house.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Tuckerman, on the porch, “we’ve
got to give them as good a time as they’d have had
at the movies.”</p>

<p>“Milly wanted to come all along,” said Tom.
“Why didn’t she say so?”</p>

<p>“I think,” answered Ben, “that she wanted to
show us that she was having just as good a time here
at home as we were having in camp; and she knew
she wasn’t.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman smiled and nodded. “Ben’s hit it on
the head. And that’s all the more reason why we
should see that they enjoy themselves this evening.”</p>

<p>They all agreed to that line of reasoning, and the
first result of it was that they suggested to Milly
that she should sail the <span class='it'>Argo</span> back to the island.
She was very much pleased, and Milly, on her mettle,
handled the craft as skillfully as Tom could have
done himself.</p>

<p>They landed, and Sarah said that she would like
to see the island, since all she had seen of it on her
first visit had been Cotterell Hall and the shore about
the camp. So the boys and Tuckerman took their
guests on a regular tour, through the woods, where
the russet-green pine-needles made a clean and fragrant
carpet, dappled with patches of sunlight; along
the little beaches, curves of yellow sand, where sandpipers
played and strutted, or flew in silver bands;
up on the ramparts of cliffs, against which the waves
rolled in and slipped and slid in white cascades over
the low-lying ledges, and so to the southern point,
where they watched the sun setting in all its glory,
tinting the sky and the sea in wonderful combinations
of shifting colors.</p>

<p>Then they went to the camp, where David made
a marvelous fish chowder of cunners and cod that Ben
had caught that morning. And for dessert they had
apple fritters and Milly’s home-made fudge.</p>

<p>When it was time to take their guests back to
Barmouth, Tom suggested that they sail around the
island. As they cruised up the ocean side they saw
a sail to the east. And after watching the distant
boat intently for some minutes David exclaimed,
“I think that’s the fishing-smack that took me from
the cove to Gosport!”</p>

<p>Tom shifted the tiller, and the <span class='it'>Argo</span> took a course
toward the larger boat. As they sailed, David, in
answer to Milly’s questions, told of his adventure
with the crew of the smack.</p>

<p>To the northeast lay a small island, and the
larger boat sailed around its southern point. The
<span class='it'>Argo</span> kept up its chase, and presently came on the
fishing-smack at anchor off a half-moon beach.</p>

<p>The big boat stood silhouetted against the violet
sky of the summer night. It was too dark to distinguish
figures on her deck. Apparently she had
come to anchor there for the night.</p>

<p>“How about it, Dave?” asked Ben. “Is that
the craft that kidnapped you?”</p>

<p>“Looks like her picture,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Want to hail your good friend Sam?” inquired
Tom.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” said David. “He might throw
something out here that the girls wouldn’t like.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t mind us,” exclaimed Milly and Sarah
in chorus.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what the smack—if it is Dave’s
boat—is doing around here,” said Tuckerman.
“There can’t be much to steal from that island.”</p>

<p>For a time the <span class='it'>Argo</span> bobbed about, but there came
no hail from the boat, no light appeared, she might
have been a ship without a crew.</p>

<p>“Let sleeping hornets lie,” Tuckerman advised.
And at the suggestion Tom sheered away. The
<span class='it'>Argo</span> sailed up the shore of the island and pointed
her bow toward the twinkling lights of the town.</p>

<p>They were all enjoying the breeze, the star-sprinkled
sky, the soft swish of the water against
the side of the boat when Ben, from a brown study,
spoke. “If the men on that smack are the thieves
who broke into Mr. Fitzhugh’s house, might they be
hunting around here for the Cotterell treasure?”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish them luck at finding it,” said
David.</p>

<p>“Thieves who broke into Mr. Fitzhugh’s house!”
cried Milly. “Oh, do tell us about that!”</p>

<p>Then the whole story came out, and when she had
heard it all Milly said positively, “I think Ben’s
right. They’re planning to steal something from
your island.”</p>

<p>“Hope they don’t take our cooking outfit,”
said Tom.</p>

<p>“Or any of my fine old colonial furniture,”
added Tuckerman.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” scoffed David. “It’s the treasure
they’re after.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to take our watch-dog back
with you?” said Sarah. “He’s fine at biting tramps.”</p>

<p>There was a laugh from the crowd. And they
were still talking of ways of protecting the island
from prowlers when the sailboat ran up to the wharf.</p>

<p>The campers escorted the girls to their homes and
then went back to the harbor.</p>

<p>On the waterfront they encountered a man—he
had been a sea-captain in his day—smoking a pipe
and regarding the lights of the harbor. He knew
the boys. “Hello, Tom,” he said, “I hear you’re
out on the island, hunting for Sir Peter’s treasure.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re camping on the island,” Tom
admitted.</p>

<p>“Haven’t found the treasure yet, have you?”
The mariner chuckled. “There’s treasure hid all
along the coast, if you believe the stories. I was
brought up on yarns about treasures, Captain Kidd’s
and others. And I’ve hunted for ’em, too. But I
never laid my hands on none. Howsomever, I
always thought there might be something to the story
about Sir Peter. But it’s one thing to think there’s
a treasure, and another to lay hands on it.”</p>

<p>“Where would you look?” asked Ben.</p>

<p>The mariner reflected. “Well, if I was hiding
a treasure I’d put it where I could get it if I wanted
it in a hurry. Seems to me I’d pick out a place in
the chimney-breast. I’ve heard of folks hiding things
in places like that.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me we’ve got to pull the house down,”
said David. “And then like as not we wouldn’t
find it.”</p>

<p>“Might be so,” the mariner agreed. “It don’t
pay to take too much trouble hunting for things like
that. But some people just have to.”</p>

<p>The four embarked in the <span class='it'>Argo</span>. “Ben’s one of
the people that just have to,” said David. “I guess
he’ll pull the house down.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of the chimney-breast,” said
Ben. “We’d better look there to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Go to it, Tige,” laughed David. “We’ll get
out the pick-ax and crow-bar.”</p>

<h1 id='t6754'>XVII—PETER COTTERELL</h1>

<p>Next morning the four campers, following the
suggestion made by the sea-captain on the Barmouth
wharf, resumed their search for the Cotterell treasure.
David treated the whole matter as a joke; he
thought that either the story about Sir Peter having
hidden his silver plate was a legend without any
foundation in fact, or that one of the family had
found the treasure and disposed of it. Tom leaned
to the same opinion, although he did not say so as
openly as did David, perhaps because he saw that
both John Tuckerman and Ben thought the treasure
was yet to be found. Ben was still as positive as
ever, and argued that if Sir Peter’s plate had ever
been discovered that fact would certainly have been
mentioned in Crusty Christopher’s notebooks.</p>

<p>They examined the chimney-breast in the kitchen
and dining-room, looking for any possible hiding-place.
They went all over the house again, looking
for any secret door or panel that they might have
missed before. They tapped the walls and they
measured them; but nowhere could they figure out
such a place as they were hunting. Finally
Tuckerman said, “I don’t see how we can search
anywhere else, unless we do as Dave suggested—pull
the house down—and I don’t want to do that.”</p>

<p>“The house is worth more than the treasure,”
said Tom.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Tuckerman agreed. He frowned
and bit his lip. “I don’t like to be stumped, that’s
the long and short of it. I don’t like to admit that I
can’t work out the puzzle.”</p>

<p>“Puzzles never bother me,” said David. “I
think they’re stupid things. I never want to know
the answer to any of the problems in the algebra
books. What good does it do you to know them?
Of course some people get so hipped over knowing
the answers they can’t eat till they find them out—whether
a dog or a rabbit will reach a given point
first, things like that, or about men rowing a boat
against the tide; but they don’t get me the least little
bit excited. Leave them to Benjie, I say.”</p>

<p>And that was what they did. They left Ben up
in the attic, the last room they had searched.
Attics fascinated Ben. In a way they were like
puzzles; there were so many odds and ends that
needed putting together. He walked idly about, looking
at chairs and tables that had lost some of their
legs, at statuettes that were broken and disfigured,
until he came to the window that opened to the east.
There he stopped in a brown study.</p>

<p>A distant sail caught his eye. It reminded him
of something. Oh, yes, from the window he could
see the line of the little island where they had found
the fishing-smack at anchor the night before. He
couldn’t tell if this sail belonged to the smack; it
was too far away; but the sight of it started a train
of thought he had been working over that morning.</p>

<p>He went downstairs and was glad to find that the
others had left the house. In the living-room he took
the two pieces of parchment from the drawer of the
secretary and carefully copied the writing on them on
a large sheet of paper. This he laid on the lid of
the desk and put an inkstand on the paper. Then
he returned the pieces of parchment to the drawer.</p>

<p>Satisfied with this, he went outdoors and crossed
the island to the beach where he had found the chest.
He sat on a log, and waited patiently. Presently he
saw a sail, to the east; and this time he felt fairly
sure that it was the same fishing-smack that they had
chased the previous night.</p>

<p>He jumped up and began to burrow in the crevice
between the rocks. He did not attempt to pull the
chest out; it was too heavy for him to do that
unaided; but he kicked his heels and pushed himself
in. And after a while he pushed himself out again
and stood up. Looking at the smack, he decided
that she was near enough for anyone on her deck
to have witnessed his strange performance.</p>

<p>The next step in his plan came when the dishes
had been washed after dinner. He proposed that
they should sail over to the little island and see if
the smack was still in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>“After the thieves, are you?” asked David.
“Now see here, my lad, if we should find them, what
then? Are you going to step aboard and tell them
they’re arrested?”</p>

<p>“Dave’s had enough of his friend Sam,” said
Tom. “He thinks if Sam meets him again he’ll
get a belaying-pin on the back of his head.”</p>

<p>“Benjie wants to argue with them,” said David.
“I’ll admit I’d like to get square with the rascal, but
I don’t see how we can do it that way.”</p>

<p>“If Dave’s sure it’s the same boat,” suggested
Tom, “we might notify the police at Barmouth.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ben, “the only way to make sure
that Dave’s right is to sail around and look at her
in daylight.”</p>

<p>“That sounds sensible,” Tuckerman agreed.
“We needn’t get into any kind of a scrap with them.”</p>

<p>So the <span class='it'>Argo</span> set sail and cruised eastward; but
although she rounded the other island several times
that afternoon her crew caught no sight of the bark
they were looking for.</p>

<p>When they got back to their own island they
found Lanky Larry and Bill Crawford fishing from
the pier. The canoe in which they had paddled over
from Camp Amoussock floated at the landing-stage.</p>

<p>“If you’re after cunners,” said Ben, “you ought
to try the rocks on the ocean side; if it’s flounders
you’re trying to tempt you won’t find them near
the pier.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t really come over here to fish,” responded
Bill, “but we always carry a couple of lines
in the canoe; that is, when it doesn’t upset. We came
over to invite you four fellows to the water sports
to-morrow morning. We’ve got a fine program, and
you can enter any of the events when you get there.”</p>

<p>“I guess the Professor will want to enter the
tub-race,” said Tom with a grin.</p>

<p>“Maybe I will,” agreed Tuckerman. “Well,
mates, how about it? The invitation sounds very
good to me.”</p>

<p>Tom and David both nodded and said they would
like to go. “You’d better count me out of it,” said
Ben. “I’ve got a date for to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Date?” inquired Tom. “What sort of a date?
With a lady or a man?”</p>

<p>“A date with myself.” Ben looked a trifle embarrassed.
“I’ve got something on hand I meant
to do in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” exclaimed David. “All right, Bill,
we’ll be over right after breakfast. And we’ll bring
Benjie along. You might enter him in the fancy
diving contest.”</p>

<p>Bill and Lanky pulled in their fishing-lines and
embarked in their canoe. The campers started to get
supper. But Ben, making an excuse that he thought
he must have mislaid his pocket-knife in the house,
hurried through the woods to the beach at the
northern end. So far as he could see no one had been
there since he had left in the morning; the chest was
still in the crevice between the rocks.</p>

<p>That evening Ben prowled about the island. He
went to Cotterell Hall, he went to the beach at the
north again, he kept a watchful eye for sails in any
quarter. When he came back to camp the other
three had turned in. And being very sleepy, he
followed their example.</p>

<p>He was up at dawn next morning, and again
made his rounds. The paper he had placed on the
lid of the secretary was apparently untouched, the
chest was still in the crevice. Breakfast was waiting
when he returned. “Now, Benjie,” said David,
“get busy with the bacon. We’re going over to
Camp Amoussock, and we want you to show those
fellows your famous flip-flap.”</p>

<p>“You go along without me,” Ben urged.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said David. “This is a sporting
proposition, and it’s up to every man to do his bit.”</p>

<p>So Ben went along with the others.</p>

<p>All of Camp Amoussock was in bathing-suits, and
the four guests were shortly attired likewise. Then
began all sorts of water sports. Tom and David and
Ben went in for most of the swimming races and the
diving contests. Tom took second place in the fifty-yard
race, and Ben won the competition for fancy
diving. When they came to the tub-race John
Tuckerman entered his name.</p>

<p>Amid shouts and cat-calls a dozen tubs set out
from the float. The race was to be around a buoy
and back to the starting-place. Tuckerman paddled
easily, keeping his tub out of the course most of the
others were taking. Two tubs jostled, and two boys
were upset into the water. Bill Crawford rounded
the buoy first, then a small, red-headed boy who
sat very still, barely patting the water with careful
finger-tips.</p>

<p>“Here comes the Professor!” cried Tom from
the beach. “Keep it up, keep it up, Professor!
You’re doing wonders!”</p>

<p>Tuckerman reached the buoy. He had found
it fairly easy to keep a straight course, but now he
had to steer to the left. To do this he tried to give
a sidewise sweep with his foot. The tub rocked,
rolled. He attempted to counter-balance; and then
he was in the water, splashing about and trying to
get hold of the tub.</p>

<p>He flopped up on one side, only to slip over on
the other. The tub might have been greased, so
difficult was it to make the round thing stay in one
position for more than a minute. At last he gave up
trying to make it behave, and swam, pushing it before
him, until he could touch bottom with his feet.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Professor,” said David, as the
bedraggled Tuckerman walked up on the beach.
“Many a man has found a tub-race his Waterloo.”</p>

<p>There were cheers from the float, and all turned
to look. Bill Crawford and the red-headed boy were
now neck and neck. Someone shouted, “Now’s your
time to spurt, Bill!”</p>

<p>Bill spurted. His tub lost its balance; Bill somersaulted
backward into the water. The red-headed
boy just managed to avoid Bill’s splashing and paddled
along more cautiously than ever, hardly touching
the water now, just directing his course with his
fingers and toes.</p>

<p>Up to the float he came. He grasped the edge,
and a moment later the boy and the tub were on
the float, and the race was won.</p>

<p>“The Tortoise wins!” cried Lanky. “Good old
Tortoise! He may be slow, but he gets there away
ahead of the Hare.”</p>

<p>Then came dinner, and then the <span class='it'>Argo</span> set sail
again. “Now, Benjie,” said David, “you can keep
that date you were telling us about. My word, but
you look impatient.”</p>

<p>Ben was impatient. He sat in the bow, keeping
a lookout for a certain sail.</p>

<p>There were no boats to be seen, however, nearer
than a three-masted schooner that moved like a
pasteboard ship along the rim of the horizon. The
<span class='it'>Argo</span> appeared to have that part of the off-shore
ocean entirely to herself, and except for the swish of
the water against her side there was no noise to
break the quiet of the summer afternoon.</p>

<p>The island stood out in its shades of green against
the brilliant blue sky. The house was a patch of
white as the sailboat drew up to the pier. The
landing made, the four campers went ashore. Ben
started up the path toward the house, and the others,
as people are apt to do when someone leads the way,
followed without any definite object in mind.</p>

<p>Ben had almost reached the front steps when the
door of Cotterell Hall opened. He stopped in surprise;
and so did the other three.</p>

<p>A man in colonial costume, buff-colored coat and
breeches, with a three-cornered hat in his hand,
stepped out at the front door.</p>

<p>The man made a bow and held out his hat in a
gesture of welcome. “I give you a good-day, gentlemen,”
he said. “What fortunate chance brings
you to Peter Cotterell’s door?”</p>

<p>Tuckerman took it on himself to answer. Returning
the bow, he said, “The good ship <span class='it'>Argo</span> has
brought four adventurers to your island, worthy sir.
We trust we do not trespass.”</p>

<p>The gentleman in buff stood with his hat at his
hip. “You’re not from the town of Barmouth?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Tuckerman, and added, “Your
island looked so inviting that we made bold to
come ashore.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’re not from Barmouth,” said the
gentleman. “I have no stomach for those folks,
rebels against His Britannic Majesty’s lawful government.
To visitors such as you my island and my
house are always open. Will you come in and
refresh yourselves?”</p>

<p>“You are very good, Sir Peter,” said Tuckerman,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Why do you call me ‘Sir Peter’?”</p>

<p>“I understood that was your title.”</p>

<p>The gentleman frowned. “I believe that some
of the rebels call me that, because of my loyalty to the
King of England. However, it is an honorable title.
I have no objection. Yes,” he added, “you may
call me Sir Peter. I like the sound.”</p>

<p>“Well then, Sir Peter,” said Tuckerman, “I
think we’ll accept your invitation with the greatest
pleasure.”</p>

<p>The gentleman on the step stood aside, and the
four marched into the house. Sir Peter indicated
a room on the left. They went into the large drawing-room,
and Ben, casting a hasty glance at the secretary,
saw that the paper he had placed on the lid
was still there.</p>

<p>“Be seated,” said Sir Peter. He stood for a
moment near the portrait on the wall, and the campers
saw how much his face and figure and the cut of his
clothes resembled those of the man in the picture.
He caught their eyes comparing him with the portrait.
“Yes, my picture,” he said. “It’s considered
a rather fair likeness.” And he added deprecatingly,
“Of course no one can ever judge a likeness
of himself.”</p>

<p>He pulled a bell-rope that hung by the big fireplace.
“I can offer you a glass of negus,” he
continued. “Something unusual, that I get from
the Barbadoes.”</p>

<p>A moment later a dark-skinned
servant—mahogany-hued in fact—came
into the room and received
his master’s orders.</p>

<p>“Will any of you take snuff?” asked Sir Peter,
when the servant had withdrawn. He produced a
small silver snuff-box from his waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>He passed the snuff-box, but each of his guests
declined. Ben, looking up with a grin, asked, “Does
your servant come from the Barbadoes, Sir Peter?”</p>

<p>“Why yes, he does.” Sir Peter helped himself
to a pinch of snuff, then dusted his coat with a fine
cambric handkerchief. “An excellent servant, too.
Indeed, I am much pleased with all my service, from
my steward James Sampson down.”</p>

<p>“James Sampson!” exclaimed Ben, his eyes
dancing. “Where have I heard that name before?”</p>

<p>At this point the servant reappeared, bearing a
lacquered tray on which were five glasses and a decanter.
He set the tray on a table, and as Sir Peter
filled the glasses the servant handed them to
the guests.</p>

<p>The refreshment was delicious. None of the
boys had ever tasted anything like it before, but all
of them declared it fine. Sir Peter poured a second
glass all round, and then, when the servant had left
again, the gentleman in buff seated himself in an
arm-chair, swung one leg over the other, and beamed
at his new friends. “As you say, the negus is
excellent,” he observed, “but several glasses will, to
use a somewhat common expression, begin to make
one see things.”</p>

<p>“We’re seeing things already,” put in David.</p>

<p>Sir Peter disregarded this remark. He twisted
his glass in his fingers. “As it happens, I’m particularly
glad that you arrived here to-day,” he continued.
“I have a number of guests here. I am
giving an entertainment this evening. The guests
are at present on the upper floors.”</p>

<p>There was a light tap of heels in the hall. Sir
Peter looked toward the door. “Here comes one of
them—a lady.” He stood up, and the campers did
likewise. “Ah, it’s Mistress Penelope Boothby,”
Sir Peter declared with a bow.</p>

<p>A young woman stood in the doorway, a very
lovely young woman in a flowered silk gown. She
courtsied down to the floor, then with a light laugh
exclaimed, “Oh la, Peter Cotterell, whom have you
here? What odd costumes the gentlemen wear!”</p>

<h1 id='t7167'>XVIII—THE PIRATES ASHORE</h1>

<p>The gentleman in buff coat and breeches turned
from the young woman in the doorway to the four
campers, who as they glanced at their own rough
outing clothes did look like a line of embarrassed
schoolboys standing in front of a teacher.</p>

<p>“Now that you mention it, Penelope,” said Peter
Cotterell, “I do note a difference between the garments
of these lads and this gentleman and those we
are accustomed to seeing worn by our neighbors. I
understand, however, that they come from a distance,
and one would hardly expect costumes to be the same
in all the colonies. It occurs to me that possibly my
new guests might like to make fresh toilets in one
of the rooms abovestairs. I have a large wardrobe,
gentlemen, and it is yours to choose from.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” said Tom. “I wonder if
you have anything big enough to fit my friend
David Norton?”</p>

<p>“When in Rome, do as the Romans do,” said
Tuckerman. “I’m sure I could pick out something
much better looking than these togs.”</p>

<p>The young woman stepped into the room. Her
blue eyes were very merry as she looked at the
awkward row. “I think an apricot coat would suit
this one,” she said, nodding at Ben. “Something
in puce this one,” she indicated Tom. “Lavender
for him,” she waved at Tuckerman. “And for the
fourth—let me see—” She squinted her eyes and
tilted her head on one side.</p>

<p>“A beautiful green,” Ben suggested. “The color
of seaweed in water.”</p>

<p>Miss Boothby laughed, and David flushed a magnificent
scarlet.</p>

<p>“He certainly oughtn’t to wear a red coat,”
said Peter Cotterell. “He’d be too much all of
one color.”</p>

<p>“I like these things I’ve got on,” said David.
“They mayn’t be very good-looking, but they suit
me first rate.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I like them, too,” agreed Miss Boothby,
and her quick smile made David flush again, this time
at the stubbornness of his tone.</p>

<p>“If you care to look at my wardrobe—”
Cotterell resumed. “Ah, here is James Sampson
now.”</p>

<p>At the door appeared a man in chocolate-colored
coat and breeches, his brown hair tied in a queue.</p>

<p>“My steward,” stated Cotterell.</p>

<p>“So you’re Sampson, are you?” asked Ben.
“I’ve heard of you, and I’m glad to make
your acquaintance. I think I’ve seen some of
your handwriting.”</p>

<p>“He writes a legible hand,” said Cotterell. “He
keeps some of my accounts. Sampson, please show
my guests to the rooms upstairs. They desire to
change their attire.”</p>

<p>Miss Boothby touched David’s arm. “For my
sake wear a suit of green,” she whispered.</p>

<p>David blushed. “Oh, very well,” he said awkwardly.
“But I guess I’ll look like a frog.”</p>

<p>They followed Sampson into the hall and up the
stairs. As they passed open doors they saw a number
of people in gay, colonial clothes. All through the
house there was the hum of voices.</p>

<p>Sampson conducted them into the attic, where
many suits and dresses hung on pegs along the walls.</p>

<p>“Here is the wardrobe,” he said. “I think you
will find everything you may need. And yonder is
a mirror.” With a bow he withdrew.</p>

<p>“Well,” exclaimed David, when the servant was
out of earshot, “what do you make of all this?”</p>

<p>“Sir Peter is certainly much more amiable than
I’d been led to suppose,” mused Tuckerman.
“There’s nothing of the hermit about him.”</p>

<p>“He’s a bird!” chuckled Tom. “I’ll bet he
gives us a mighty fine supper.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame him a bit for wanting to keep
those roughnecks over in Barmouth from melting up
his silver,” Ben asserted.</p>

<p>“See here, you fellows,” broke in David, “I
want to know what’s the game.”</p>

<p>“Game?” echoed Ben.</p>

<p>“Game?” said Tom. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Game?” repeated Tuckerman, and his tone was
a trifle indignant. “I don’t call it a game when a
gentleman like Sir Peter Cotterell invites us to
his party.”</p>

<p>David sat down on a sofa. “All right, all right.
I’m the goat, as usual. Fetch me a green coat
and trousers.”</p>

<p>“I daresay Miss Boothby will dance with you,”
Tom cheered him.</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>You</span> may like this sort of thing,” said David,
“but it’s not in my line.”</p>

<p>Ben threw a coat at him. “Take that. Hello,
here’s a shelf full of wigs. Want to try a white
one, Dave?”</p>

<p>For the next five minutes they looked about the
room, at the coats and the breeches and waistcoats,
at the wigs and the other articles that made up
Sir Peter’s wardrobe.</p>

<p>Then they began to try on the costumes, seeking
for the proper sizes. Ben could find nothing that
suited him exactly. And while they were trying on
different coats, there came a sound of singing
from downstairs.</p>

<p>Ben, holding a coat in each hand, went into the
hall and leaned over the banisters. Men and women
were singing a quaint, old-fashioned song in the
dining-room. The tune was fascinating, at times it
sounded like a jig, at times there were different
parts for the different voices. Ben listened, nodding
his head in rhythm with the music. “You ought
to hear this,” he called over his shoulder to the three
in the attic. “It’s a regular musical show.”</p>

<p>The others came out into the hall. Tuckerman
beat time on the banister with a powdered wig he
had been trying to squeeze on his head. Tom, putting
his hands on David’s shoulders, began to dance to
the tune.</p>

<p>With a grin, Ben turned and went back to the
attic. “I’ll beat them to it,” he muttered, and flinging
down the two coats he was holding he took a
yellow satin coat, embroidered with silver lace, from
a peg on the wall.</p>

<p>This coat was a fine sample of the tailor’s art.
But Ben, having taken it down, stared at the peg
from which it had hung, and at the wall behind it.</p>

<p>He gave an exclamation, a low whistle of surprise.
He knocked on the wall with his knuckles. He
glanced through the open door, and saw that the
others were still occupied with the singing. He
backed away from the wall, still keeping his eyes on
it. And then he stumbled over a footstool and sat
down with a bump on the floor.</p>

<p>He got up and laid the embroidered coat on a
chair by the window. He looked outdoors. And
then for the second time in five minutes he uttered
an exclamation. The fishing-smack was standing
close inshore on the eastern side of the island. He
could see her moving slowly to the north, her canvas
plainly visible above the tops of the trees.</p>

<p>“Gee whillikins!” muttered Ben. “I’ll bet my
scheme worked!”</p>

<p>Another minute and he was out in the hall. The
singing downstairs had stopped and there was a
clapping of hands.</p>

<p>“Come here!” ordered Ben.</p>

<p>The other three followed him into the attic, to the
window opening to the east.</p>

<p>“Is that your fishing-smack, Dave?” Ben
demanded.</p>

<p>David looked. “By Jove, I believe it is!”</p>

<p>“Do you want to know where she’s going?”
was Ben’s next question.</p>

<p>“Shoot,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“She’s going to the beach where I found the chest
in the hiding-place in the rocks. Her crew are after
that chest, I’ll bet you a fiver!”</p>

<p>The three stared at him in surprise. “What
makes you so certain?” asked Tuckerman.</p>

<p>“Because I know. I have reasons for knowing.
They’re after that chest. They think it’s the Cotterell
treasure, just as I thought it was.”</p>

<p>“You mean they’re going to land on our beach
and carry off our chest under our very noses?”
demanded Tom.</p>

<p>“They are unless we stop them,” nodded Ben.</p>

<p>“Then,” said David, “I’m going to stop them.
Seems to me there was an old musket somewhere
around here.”</p>

<p>There was an old musket in the corner of the
attic; there were two, in fact; and a fowling-piece
and a couple of antique duelling-pistols. The boys
and Tuckerman seized on all the firearms, regardless
of the rust that came off on their clothes, and hurried
into the hall.</p>

<p>Down the stairs they went, making a great noise.
And the clatter of their feet was so loud that the
gentleman in buff and all his friends ran out from the
dining-room to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s an army coming!” cried Peter
Cotterell in great surprise.</p>

<p>The four halted in the front hall.</p>

<p>“What’s the meaning of this!” exclaimed
Cotterell. “I invited you to share my wardrobe,
not to ransack the house for weapons. Come, will
one of you please explain?” Indignation mingled in
his tone with surprise.</p>

<p>“There’s a boat off-shore, and her crew is going
to land on the beach at the northern point and steal
your treasure chest,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“My treasure chest! My silver plate!” Cotterell
raised his hand, clenched it into a fist. “Those rascally
rebels from Barmouth!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where they come from,” said Ben.
“But we’re going to chase them away.”</p>

<p>“Chase them away?” Cotterell spurned the suggestion.
“No, sir. We’ll capture them.”</p>

<p>He looked around at his guests. “Gentlemen,
what do you say? Would you like to bag a
few robbers?”</p>

<p>There were shouts of approval.</p>

<p>“Not so loud, not so loud,” said Cotterell. He
turned to the boys and Tuckerman. “Can you spare
us a few of those extra musquetoons, or whatever
they are, that you found abovestairs? With those,
and the fencing swords in the living-room, and a few
other odds and ends, we should do quite nicely. I
have a pistol myself. I never go without it in these
revolutionary days. Let me see. I left it in the
kitchen, in a pot on the shelf, where it would be out
of the way.”</p>

<p>The firearms were handed around, and shortly a
group of fantastically-garbed people stood in front of
the house. The campers and Cotterell and Sampson
were to lead the expedition, and some of the ladies
insisted on bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>They had not gone far, however, when Sampson
suggested a new idea to the others, and after a few
minutes’ talk Cotterell’s steward and two of the
other men left the main party and turned off in the
direction of the creek.</p>

<p>Through the woods went the expedition, a long
line of people following Ben, who had a musket
almost as long as himself stuck over his shoulder,
which necessitated his constantly ducking and dodging
to avoid overhanging branches.</p>

<p>When they reached the northern edge of the
woods they divided into three bands. One was
headed by Ben and David, the second by Tom and
Cotterell, and the third by Tuckerman. Each band
was to make its way down to the beach in front of
the rocks by a different path, but not to come out
from the shelter of the bushes in the ravines until its
leader was sure that the crew from the fishing-smack
had landed and were looking for the chest. The
ladies were to stay in the woods. To this Miss
Penelope Boothby objected. She said that with the
riding-crop she had picked up in the house she could
easily defend herself against a dozen pirates.
Cotterell said, “I’m sure you could, my dear Penelope.
But the bright colors of your gown might give us
away. And if we have to crawl through the brambles,
what would happen to your light silk dress?”</p>

<p>Ben and David, with two men, threaded their way
down a ravine to a network of bushes that fringed
the edge of the beach. From here, without being
seen themselves, they could see what was going on.
The fishing-smack had come to anchor a hundred
yards off shore, four men had rowed to the island and
were now on the beach. Pointing to one of these
men, David whispered in Ben’s ear, “That’s my
friend Sam. I’d know his ugly mug anywhere.”</p>

<p>“They’re after the chest,” Ben returned. “Yes,
they’ve found the right place. See, one of them’s
crawling in, with a rope in his hand.”</p>

<p>Three bands of watchers, at three places along the
beach, saw the crew of the smack haul the chest out
from the crevice. As soon as they had it out they
threw open the top. And as they all bent over, eager
to lay hands on the Cotterell treasure, a voice hailed
them from a clump of bushes not fifty feet away.</p>

<p>“Throw up your hands!” cried the voice.
“Throw them up quick!”</p>

<p>The crew stood up. They saw a man in buff
coat and breeches facing them, a pistol in his hand.</p>

<p>“Up with your hands!” cried another voice
from a bush on the other side.</p>

<p>The crew hesitated a second. One of them
glanced over his shoulder. “They’ve got us cornered!”
he muttered, and stuck his hands up over
his head.</p>

<p>The three scouting parties marched out on to the
beach. The muskets and firearms were leveled at the
four men round the chest.</p>

<p>“It’s a regular army!” exclaimed one of the
crew. And putting on as much of an air of bravado
as he could with his hands above his head, he demanded,
“What do you want of us? We’re not
stealing anything. We found that chest here.”</p>

<p>“Keep your hands up!” cautioned Cotterell, as
he walked forward. “As you say, you’re surrounded
by an army. And while your hands are up, I’ll ask
some of my friends to see if you have weapons in
your pockets.”</p>

<p>The search was quickly made, and each man
relieved of a pistol.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Cotterell, “you may ease your
muscles. But let me tell you the first one who tries to
get away will be knocked down and handcuffed.”</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll go easy,” said the man who
was known to David as Sam. “But I don’t know
what you’re after. We came ashore and saw this
box in that crack in the rocks.”</p>

<p>“It’s my box,” said Cotterell. “I own everything
on this island.”</p>

<p>“Well, take it if it’s yours,” growled Sam. “We
don’t want it. I thought a box on the beach was
public property.”</p>

<p>“You think a good many things are public property,”
Cotterell retorted. He looked at Ben and
David. “Have either of you seen this man anywhere
before?”</p>

<p>“I have,” said David. “He’s the fellow who
carried me off in that boat out there.”</p>

<p>“Has anybody here seen any of these other
men?” Cotterell asked next.</p>

<p>Tom spoke up. “I’m pretty sure they’re the
fellows Lanky Larry and I followed from the cove
to the house called the Gables.”</p>

<p>“And what are they suspected of having done at
the Gables?” continued Cotterell.</p>

<p>“Of stealing some jewels,” said Tom.</p>

<p>The man in the buff coat nodded. “In other
words, they are probably not very desirable citizens
to have at large. I think it’s my duty to give them
into custody.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now,” said Sam. “You don’t really
know anything about us. There’s your chest. You
see we haven’t taken anything from it. We were
sailing along the coast and we came ashore to have
a look at the island. That’s a reasonable thing to do.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t any right to arrest us!” exclaimed
one of the other men. “You haven’t got a warrant.
And who’s going to believe what that young fellow
said about seeing us somewhere else?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we can supply the authorities with
further proof,” said Cotterell with a smile.</p>

<p>There came a shout from someone on board the
fishing-smack, and all those on the beach looked in
that direction. A man was waving a handkerchief
over the side of the boat.</p>

<h1 id='t7598'>XIX—THE COTTERELL SILVER PLATE</h1>

<p>While the campers and Cotterell and his guests
had been making prisoners of the four men on the
beach, the steward Sampson and the two others who
had separated from the main party had embarked in
a motor-boat that was moored in the creek and made
their way out to the fishing-smack. To the surprise
of the skipper, who was the only man aboard, two
men in fantastic knee-breeches had swung themselves
over one side of his boat while he was idly
surveying the northern point of the island from the
other side. He turned to find himself looking at
the muzzle of the most remarkable pistol he had ever
seen. Being unarmed himself, he had immediately
put up his hands. Whereupon the two men had
smiled, and the one with the pistol, lowering that
ancient weapon, had said, “That’s a good fellow. Is
there anyone else aboard?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the skipper, not wanting to have the
smack searched.</p>

<p>“Take a look through his clothes for a weapon,”
the man with the pistol said to his companion.</p>

<p>No weapon was found. The man in the motor-boat
came aboard, and two of the men went into the
smack’s cabin, while the third guarded the skipper.</p>

<p>When the two returned from the cabin some time
later, one of them went to the rail and shouted and
waved his handkerchief toward shore. And presently
Cotterell and Tom, David and Ben rowed out in the
smack’s boat.</p>

<p>In the cabin were the hats and cloaks and the
other things that Tom and Lanky had seen in the
shack at the cove. Sampson set out at once in the
motor-boat for Barmouth, and before the sun had
touched the tops of the trees the four men on the
beach and the skipper were in custody of the police,
charged with having stolen certain valuables from
the Gables.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Cotterell, when he and his guests
were again on the island, “my treasure is still secure
from the rebels, thanks to you,” and he bowed to
the campers.</p>

<p>“Oh, is your famous dinner-set really in that
chest?” asked Miss Penelope Boothby. She went to
the chest and looked at its contents. “Why, it’s only
clothes and bric-a-brac! There’s no silverware there.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Cotterell, smiling. “That is not my
silver plate. I keep it better hid than that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do let us dine off it to-night,” begged Miss
Boothby. “I should dearly love to see it.”</p>

<p>Cotterell looked perplexed. “Why, I should like
you to,” he answered. Then he glanced at the sun.
“But the party waits. And it was my intention to
dance a minuet on the lawn before my house while
it was daylight. Come, friends, come along with me.”</p>

<p>They went back through the woods. The boys
and Tuckerman branched off by the path to their
camp, promising to come to Cotterell Hall in time to
join the party. And, once out of hearing of the
others, David turned to Ben. “You’re a cute fellow,
Benjie. How’d you ever guess that the men from the
smack would go after that chest?”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind telling you now,” said Ben with
a grin. “I was pretty sure that those men were
snooping around the house, looking for clues to the
treasure, and so I put a copy of that message on the
parchment out on the lid of the desk, where they
couldn’t very well fail to see it. Then I went down
on the beach by the cliff when the smack was fairly
near shore, and tried to give them the notion that I
was looking for something. Well, they bit all right.
They thought the treasure was hidden there, just as I
thought myself when I first saw Sampson’s message.”</p>

<p>“I’ll hand it to you, sonny,” said Tom. “You
turned the trick! And that’s the crowd that stole the
jewels from the Gables, just as I thought.”</p>

<p>“They stole some of Mr. Fitzhugh’s costumes,”
said Ben. “It seems to me that the fact that we
found those costumes in the cabin shows what they’ve
been doing.”</p>

<p>They sat on the bank a few minutes, talking over
the adventure. Then Tuckerman stood up. “Well,
we’re due at Cotterell Hall. Wash your hands and
brush your hair, so you’ll look your smartest.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose we’ll have to dance?” asked
David, as he ran a comb through his thatch of hair.</p>

<p>“I think that one of the ladies has her eye on
you,” said Tuckerman, laughing. “However, if
you’ve got a game leg, I’ll be glad to take your place.”</p>

<p>As they reached the house Peter Cotterell came
out at the door. Behind him were Miss Boothby
and Sampson. “My wardrobe is still upstairs,” the
buff-coated man said genially. “Make what use of
it you please.”</p>

<p>This time the campers found costumes quickly.
Even Ben, who kept looking at the row of pegs from
which he had taken down the yellow satin coat, got
into that coat and a pair of breeches. There was
the sound of a violin in front of the house, and as
they came down the steps they found the whole party
taking places for a dance.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we don’t know the minuet,” said
Tuckerman, hesitating.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s easy enough,” said the host. “I’ll
call off the figures.”</p>

<p>Ben gave Tom a nudge, and pointed out two men
who stood at a little distance with a big camera.
“Sir Peter’s up to date,” he whispered. “I guess
it’s the first time anyone ever took moving-pictures
on Cotterell’s Island.”</p>

<p>Meantime Miss Boothby had gone up to David
and boldly proclaimed that he was to dance with her.
The suit that David had put on in the attic happened
to be green, and when she reminded him that that
was the color she had asked him to wear he turned
beet red and stammered something about “trying
to please a lady.”</p>

<div class='imgcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-276.jpg' alt='' id='img4'/>
<p class='caption'>“My wardrobe is still upstairs. Make what use of it you please.”</p>
</div>

<p>“We will stand near Mr. Cotterell, and I will
show you all the steps,” she said. “I could tell you
were very light on your feet the very first time I
saw you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can pick them up pretty well in a clog
or a shuffle,” admitted David.</p>

<p>“I knew it! I knew it!” exclaimed the delighted
Miss Boothby; and pouncing on David’s hand she led
him to where Peter Cotterell was assigning places
to the dancers.</p>

<p>Tom and Ben and Tuckerman all had partners.
The violin began to play, and Cotterell led off the
dance. The host was very graceful and so was the
lady he danced with, and they posed and bowed and
courtsied constantly as they went through the stately
measures of the minuet. The others copied their
leaders, and after a few minutes’ practice contrived
to do it well. Meantime the camera clicked, taking
reels of pictures of the old-fashioned dance.</p>

<p>There was a final bow and courtesy, a final posing
in position. Then Cotterell raised his hand. “That
was beautifully done, my friends,” he said. “Surely
my island home has never witnessed a more graceful
scene. I trust you have all gained an excellent appetite
for dinner.”</p>

<p>“What a gorgeous sunset!” exclaimed Miss
Boothby, looking toward the water.</p>

<p>They all moved down in the direction of the
pier. As they came in view of the broad and many-colored
bay they saw a sailboat heading for the landing.
Cotterell stopped and again raised his hand.
“Can it be that the people of Barmouth are coming
out here again?” he demanded indignantly. “I’ll
have nothing to do with them, and they know it! I
will not give them my plate!”</p>

<p>The sailboat came on. Cotterell, followed by the
others, walked out on the pier.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” called out the buff-coated
man. “This is Cotterell’s Island.”</p>

<p>“We know it is,” answered a man in the boat.
“Who are you? You look like Sir Peter.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any rebels from Barmouth landing
here,” came the reply.</p>

<p>“There aren’t any rebels nowadays. We won
the Revolution.”</p>

<p>“You shan’t have my silver plate.”</p>

<p>There were laughs from those in the boat. “We
don’t want it. We’ve brought paper plates of
our own.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Cotterell, “this is most extraordinary!”
He turned to his guests. “Shall I let
them land?”</p>

<p>“We’ve got an ice cream freezer aboard,” called
a girl in the boat. “Fresh strawberry ice cream.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Miss Boothby, at Cotterell’s elbow,
“we’ll let them land with that cargo.”</p>

<p>The sailboat touched the landing-stage, and two
men, two women and two girls got out. “Hello,
Benjie,” cried Milly Hallett, waving her hand
to the dark-haired boy. “What grand company
you’ve got!”</p>

<p>The arrivals were Mr. and Mrs. Hallett and Mr.
and Mrs. Hooper and Milly and Sarah. They went
up on the pier, where Tom introduced them to
Peter Cotterell.</p>

<p>Mr. Hallett looked at the company. “I’d no
idea, sir,” he said, addressing Cotterell, “that your
island was entertaining so many guests to-day. I
wish I’d brought a dozen gallons of strawberry
ice cream.”</p>

<p>“You are welcome anyhow, Mr. Hallett,” answered
Cotterell graciously. “I think perhaps I can
supply any deficiency.” He turned to his steward.
“Sampson, will you bring Mr. Hallett’s ice cream
freezer up to the Hall?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Sir Peter,” protested Mr. Hallett.
“We were going to have a simple picnic supper
outdoors.”</p>

<p>The buff-coated gentleman bowed. “Your pardon,
sir; but I am the overlord here. Those whom
I allow to land on my island are my guests during
their stay. You must dine at my board.”</p>

<p>Peter Cotterell offered his arm to Mrs. Hallett,
and led the way up to the house. Sampson and Tom
brought up the rear, carrying the ice cream freezer.</p>

<p>They all went into the large front room. “Dinner
in half-an-hour,” announced the host.</p>

<p>“That reminds me,” said Miss Boothby; “since
we’re all friends here, aren’t you going to offer us
dinner from your silver plate?”</p>

<p>“Really, Penelope,” expostulated Cotterell, “you
repeat yourself. That’s the second time this afternoon
you’ve mentioned the same idea.”</p>

<p>“It seems only hospitable,” pouted Miss Boothby.</p>

<p>Cotterell looked at the floor. “Well, you see,” he
began. “You see——”</p>

<p>The lady interrupted. “I believe you’ve forgotten
where you put it!”</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause. Cotterell flushed,
bit his lip.</p>

<p>“Well, if he has,” piped up Ben, “he’s only mislaid
it. I think I can show him where it is.”</p>

<p>Everyone turned to look at the fellow who spoke
with such confidence. John Tuckerman stared,
and so did Tom, while David gave a low whistle
and muttered, “It’s just like Benjie to do something
ridiculous.”</p>

<p>Cotterell smiled. “I am a great hand at mislaying
things—it’s my besetting sin. Now I would
be very much obliged if you would show me where
I did put that silverware.”</p>

<p>“How funny,” said Miss Boothby, “that a total
stranger should know. I understand that he came
here for the first time this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“What joke is he going to play on them?”
Tuckerman whispered to Tom. “I can’t imagine
what he’s got in mind.”</p>

<p>“He’s putting up a good bluff,” Tom whispered
back. “He looks very much in earnest.”</p>

<p>And Ben did look as if his statement had been
perfectly reasonable. He nodded at Cotterell. “You
may be a great hand at mislaying things—I don’t
know much about that; but I do know that you’re
a wonder at hiding them.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, I am,” agreed the buff-coated man
with a pleased chuckle. “I can hide things so well
that very often I don’t know where to look for
them myself.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Miss Boothby, “where is the silver?
It’s almost time for dinner.”</p>

<p>Ben bowed, imitating the courtly manner of
Cotterell. “Ladies and gentlemen,” said he, “if
you will be so good as to fall into line behind me,
I will endeavor to answer Miss Boothby’s question.”</p>

<p>Like the Pied Piper of Hamelin, Ben, in his
yellow satin coat and knee-breeches, went into the
hall and up the stairs, followed by Cotterell, Penelope
Boothby, Milly and Sarah, Tuckerman, Tom and
David, and a line of men and women.</p>

<p>He led them into the attic. When they were all
in the big room he pointed to the wall along which
ran the row of pegs from one of which he had taken
the coat.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, “please tell me what you see.”</p>

<p>“A wall,” answered Milly promptly, “with some
pegs to hang things on.”</p>

<p>“Miss Hallett is certainly right,” said Tuckerman.
“There may be some cobwebs, too, up under
the ceiling. Do you mean the cobwebs, Ben?”</p>

<p>“There are lots of more interesting things here,”
said Sarah, looking around. “There’s that lovely
green lacquered temple.”</p>

<p>“Don’t joke with the magician, Sally,” David
admonished her. “He wants you to look at
those pegs.”</p>

<p>“No, that particular wall is the most interesting
thing in this attic,” Ben declared stoutly. “I think
it’s the most interesting thing in the house.”</p>

<p>They all looked where he pointed, but none of
them caught what he was driving at.</p>

<p>“Why, Professor Tuckerman,” said Ben, “I
thought you were a better observer.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see anything but the pegs and
some rather dingy wallpaper,” Tuckerman confessed.</p>

<p>“Ah, now you’re talking! You do see the wallpaper,
do you?” Ben continued.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Tuckerman. “It’s the pictured
kind, like that in the rooms downstairs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, it’s not,” exclaimed Ben. “There’s
not another piece like that in Cotterell Hall.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” said Tuckerman. “Well, it represents
some sort of outdoor scene.”</p>

<p>“I think those are meant to be pine trees,”
Cotterell put in.</p>

<p>“And that looks like a sunset,” Miss Boothby
contributed. “Though some of the red has
rubbed off.”</p>

<p>Ben bobbed his head. “And those yellowish
things are rocks.” He stepped up to the wallpaper
and pointed with his finger. “Three pines that
stand between two rocks where the sun goes
down.” He turned. “Does that convey anything
to you, Professor?”</p>

<p>“By Jove! You’re right! So it does!”
Tuckerman exclaimed. “That was the old saying!
The hiding-place is just beyond the three pines that
stand between two rocks where the sun goes down.”</p>

<p>“Exactly!” said Ben, in a quiet tone of triumph.
He rapped on the wall with his knuckles. “It’s wood.
Mr. Cotterell, have you any objection to our taking
this part of the wall down?”</p>

<p>“None in the least,” answered Cotterell.
“Sampson, will you be so good as to get some
chisels and hammers? I think you’ll find them in the
little room to the right of the kitchen.”</p>

<p>While Sampson went on his errand Ben and Tom
and Tuckerman fingered that part of the wall that
was bounded by the picture. They found the edges
of two boards, running from floor to ceiling, and
when they had peeled off the paper that concealed
these edges they discovered there was a panel.</p>

<p>Sampson returned with a couple of chisels and
hammers. Wedging the chisels in between the boards
and giving a couple of light blows, he pried the panel
loose. Ben pulled it away. Behind it, under the
eaves of the house, was a compartment. And in the
compartment was a big square box.</p>

<p>Ben and Tom and Tuckerman pulled the box out
into the attic. It was fastened with a single lock.
Hammer and chisel soon knocked the lock off.
Tuckerman raised the lid. “Yes, it’s the Cotterell
silver plate!” he cried. “By Jove, we’ve found
it now!”</p>

<p>They handed the plate around, magnificent old
silverware that was worth a small fortune. And
they were still admiring it when a dinner gong
sounded downstairs.</p>

<h1 id='t8027'>XX—SIR PETER’S PARTY</h1>

<p>When none of his guests could eat any more of
the delicious ice cream that topped off a wonderful
dinner, the buff-coated gentleman rose from his chair
at the head of the table. They had dined from the
famous Cotterell silver service, and the candles that
now illuminated the shining mahogany table were
fastened in exquisite candlesticks that had been in
the treasure chest.</p>

<p>The buff-coated gentleman raised a glass that
stood beside his plate. “My friends,” he said, “our
guests from Barmouth tell us that the Revolution is
over; so there would be no object in keeping the
Cotterell treasure hidden any longer. But it was well
hidden. So well hidden indeed that it required a
genius like Benjamin Sully to find out where
it was. I propose a toast to that master detective,
Benjamin Sully.”</p>

<p>All, except Ben, lifted their glasses and drank,
nodding at the dark-haired boy.</p>

<p>Then Ben stood up. “I propose a toast to Sir
Peter,” he said, “who surely does know how to give
people a good time.”</p>

<p>That toast was drunk also. Then Tuckerman got
to his feet. “Sir Peter, I am proud of you,” he said.
“I don’t believe a more delightful party was ever
given in Cotterell Hall.”</p>

<p>The man at the head of the table smiled. “I’m
glad to hear you say that, John Tuckerman,” he
responded. “For, in a way, I felt that to-night I’d
been usurping a place that was rightfully yours.
For, of course, this is your house, and this is your
silver plate.”</p>

<p>“Then who are you?” piped up Sarah Hooper
from the foot of the table.</p>

<p>“I think he’s Roderick Fitzhugh,” said Tom, who
sat beside Sarah.</p>

<p>“I think he’s Mr. Joseph Hastings,” volunteered
Ben.</p>

<p>The buff-coated gentleman nodded, “You are
both right. Joseph Hastings, Roderick Fitzhugh,
and Peter Cotterell. I’m quite a versatile fellow.
I’ve a passion for acting, to tell the truth.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were Joseph Hastings,” said Ben,
“when I met you at the Gables.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s my right name. But Roderick
Fitzhugh sounded so much more romantic. And I’d
invited a houseful of guests to help me act a play
I’d written for the moving-pictures. We all took
the names we were to have in the play.” He pointed
to Penelope Boothby. “She was the fair Maid
Rosalind. And my steward Sampson yonder was
Sir Marmaduke Midchester. And we liked our costumes
so much that we wore them most of the time.
That’s how I happened to be in Lincoln green when
Master Ben drove up.”</p>

<p>“And it was the snuff-box you bought in
Barmouth that I found in the chest in the cliff,”
asserted Ben. “How did it happen to come there?”</p>

<p>Joseph Hastings pushed his chair back from the
table and crossed his legs. “That’s quite a long
story. But I suppose you’d like to hear it. I have
a friend who knows John Tuckerman very well, and
he wrote me that Tuckerman had come here to take
possession of this island and its house. That sounded
very interesting. So I came over here in my motor-boat
with Martin Locke—that’s Sir Marmaduke,
alias Sampson, and Miss Adelaide Lawson—that’s
Penelope Boothby—it was a day or two before you
campers arrived—and we found we could open one
of the drawing-room windows and get into the house
that way. Then we discovered the note stuck in the
picture frame, and so we learned there was a secret
about a family treasure.”</p>

<p>“And you left the window open a little when you
went out,” put in Tom. “That’s how it happened
that Ben’s candle blew out.”</p>

<p>“Did we?” said Hastings. “I didn’t know we
did that. But we found some wax and took an impression
of the key-hole in the front door, and
I had a key made to fit it in Barmouth. I thought
we’d have some fun with John Tuckerman
and his friends.”</p>

<p>“You did, all right,” said Tuckerman. “I’ll
forgive you for making that key. I suppose that’s
what those men from the fishing-smack did when
they broke in here.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry if I set a bad example,” Hastings
answered. “But they didn’t learn the trick from us.
Well, a day or two later we three came back again.”</p>

<p>“You landed from the creek?” Ben asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; we didn’t want you to see us, and the
creek was on the other side of the island from
your camp.”</p>

<p>“And one of you took off his shoes before he
landed?” Ben questioned again.</p>

<p>“Yes, Martin did. He carried Miss Lawson
ashore.” Hastings laughed. “You saw his footprints,
didn’t you? We thought you might find them,
so we came back later and rubbed them out.”</p>

<p>“Gigantic footprints,” murmured David.</p>

<p>They all laughed, while Martin Locke blushed red.</p>

<p>“Yes, they are pretty big,” Hastings continued.
“Well, when we came that time we found the notebooks
in the drawing-room. Miss Lawson glanced
through them, and read that part about a mahogany
man with long, skinny legs and the clipper ship. We
got an old piece of parchment and some purplish ink
and we wrote out that message and signed it James
Sampson. Then we cut it in two and put one-half
in the secret drawer of the secretary and the other
half in the model of a ship in the attic. We wanted
to find out just how clever you were. We thought you
might take the desk to be the mahogany man.”</p>

<p>“We got the idea of that from something Sally
Hooper said,” Ben put in. “And the secretary certainly
has long, skinny legs and is made of mahogany.
Still, we mightn’t have connected it with Sir Peter’s
mahogany man, if it hadn’t been for Sally.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you hadn’t,” Hastings continued,
“we’d have thought up some other way to have you
find that message on the parchment. We were very
proud of that little scheme. Martin wrote the letters
with his left hand, so they’d look as if Sir Peter’s
servant might have done them, and he put water into
the ink, so as to give it a nice, antique, faded appearance.
We wanted you to have the fun of finding
some sort of a treasure, you see.”</p>

<p>“And didn’t you take a look around for the real
treasure mentioned in the note in the picture frame?”
Tuckerman asked.</p>

<p>“Well, we did take a squint,” Hastings acknowledged.
“But we didn’t think it likely we’d find that,
if none of the Cotterells had been able to do it. We
thought more about having some fun with you
campers.” He looked at the three boys. “And we
did give you a good time, didn’t we?—particularly
Ben?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did,” nodded Ben. “I was pretty well
excited when I found that second piece of parchment
in the hold of the ship.”</p>

<p>“When we’d fixed up the message,” Hastings
resumed, “the next thing was to provide the treasure.
Of course we’d already made a note of that crevice
in the cliffs with the mark like a cross. I had an old
chest at the Gables, and we filled it with some old
costumes I had on hand, and then one day when I
was in Barmouth I picked up some odds and ends
from a dealer in antiques there, a fellow by the name
of Haskins.”</p>

<p>“And that’s where the silver snuff-box comes
in,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s where it comes in,” Hastings admitted.
“Though I must say that I was surprised
when you drove up to the Gables that day and wanted
to know if Joseph Hastings had anything to do with
that snuff-box you’d found on the island. I didn’t
tell the dealer my name.”</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t know your name,” said Ben.
“I asked him that. You see, as soon as I saw what
was in the chest I had a suspicion that someone was
playing a game on us. Those things weren’t the
Cotterell treasure; and why should anyone take so
much trouble to hide such things on the island? Then
I knew there had been people here, the footprints
by the creek, the handkerchief in the kitchen——”</p>

<p>“What’s that about a handkerchief?” interrupted
Martin Locke.</p>

<p>“The Professor found a handkerchief on the
table in the kitchen,” Ben explained. “A lady’s
handkerchief, with the initials A. S. L.”</p>

<p>“So that’s where I left it!” exclaimed Miss
Lawson. “Those are my initials—Adelaide
Sanderson Lawson.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there was the handkerchief and there were
the footprints,” Ben continued. “That showed we
weren’t the only people who had been to the island.
And so, when we went to Barmouth, I took the snuffbox
along, and dropped in on Mr. Haskins. He knew
the snuff-box at once, and told me that the man who
had bought it from him, and some other things too,
had come in a big red car with a silver eagle on the
radiator cap, and that the car had a Massachusetts
license and the man was wearing green-checked
knickerbockers. He didn’t know the man’s name.”</p>

<p>“I guess those green checks are rather conspicuous,”
murmured Hastings. “But how did you connect
the purchaser with me?”</p>

<p>“Through the clerk at the hotel where you
stopped for dinner, and the man you bought a new
tire from,” Ben answered, and he told how he had
found his way to the Gables.</p>

<p>“Pretty clever,” laughed Hastings. “But instead
of finding out why I’d put those things in the
chest you went hooked-rug hunting with me.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ben, “when we came back to your
house I thought you must be Joseph Hastings, but I
didn’t get any good opening to follow up the clue.
And then there was all that excitement over the
robbers. But when I saw you doing those moving-pictures
I sized you up as a person who’d like to play
a game of some sort on us.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether that’s a knock at me or
not,” said Hastings. “But I do like to play games.
And that’s why, when I learned that you’d found the
chest, I thought it would be good fun to come over
here as Sir Peter Cotterell, dress my guests in Revolutionary
costumes, and take some moving-pictures
on the island. Martin and I came over to see about
it; that was the afternoon when you invited us to
stay to supper and Martin sang his song.”</p>

<p>“It was a splendid idea,” said Tuckerman, “and
you did it up brown.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.” Hastings bowed. “Such words
from a descendant of Sir Peter are a compliment
indeed. We learned that you were going over to the
water sports at Camp Amoussock this morning, so
we thought we’d have a clear field. We brought a
flotilla of boats—they’re moored in the creek now—and
a good supply of costumes, and cooks and food
and the moving-picture camera. I had one of my
men make up like a servant from the Barbadoes, stain
his face and hands with mahogany juice; he’s the
one who brought us the negus; though it isn’t really
negus—it’s loganberry juice and soda-water—and
I got Martin Locke to play the part of Sampson.”
Hastings looked at Locke and laughed. “Though
I don’t think Martin could possibly have carried that
treasure chest all the way from here to the
north shore.”</p>

<p>“You certainly do things up thoroughly,” said
Mr. Hallett.</p>

<p>“But what made the party a real success,” said
Hastings, “was what our friend Ben Sully did.
First, the capture of the thieves, and second, the finding
of the real Cotterell treasure. That’s a pretty
fine showing for one day, Ben.”</p>

<p>“It was just luck I found that chest in the attic,”
Ben answered. “I thought all along that the pines
and the rocks mentioned in that notebook were actual
outdoor pines and rocks, just as I suppose everybody’s
thought who’s hunted for the treasure. I’ve
been up in the attic a lot of times, and never particularly
noticed the wallpaper—it’s pretty much faded
and blurred, as you saw; but when I was taking
this coat off one of the pegs this afternoon, I did
happen to notice that there was a yellowish sun and
some pines and rocks in the design on the wall. Then
the idea struck me all at once. Mightn’t that be the
place the words in the notebook meant? And the
more I looked at that wallpaper the more I felt certain
of it. I suppose Sir Peter told someone jokingly one
day that the treasure was hidden beyond the three
pines that stand between two rocks where the sun
goes down, and that fooled the people who’ve looked
for it ever since. He surely did like his joke.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell us about it as soon as
you hit on that great idea, Benjie?” It was Tom
who asked the question.</p>

<p>“Why, then I saw the fishing-smack, and wanted
to go after the thieves.”</p>

<p>“But afterwards?” said Tom. “Don’t tell me
you’d forgotten about it when we stopped at
the camp.”</p>

<p>Ben looked a trifle embarrassed. “Why, the
fact is,” he replied, “I thought I’d like to spring it at
a dramatic moment. I had an idea that Miss Boothby
would ask Sir Peter again to show us the Cotterell
silver plate—she wanted to tease him about it—and
when she had him up a tree would be the right time
for me to speak out and tell what I’d discovered.”</p>

<p>“That’s one on you, Adelaide,” laughed Joseph
Hastings. “Ben saw how you love to ask awkward
questions. And he likes dramatic things as much as
I do. He sprung it at just the right moment.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman stood up and walked to the door that
opened into the hall. From there he looked down the
length of the room, at the table gleaming with silver,
at the many candles, at the gaily-clad company.
“Yes,” he said, “I think this is worthy of Sir Peter.
I’m glad that Cotterell Hall has held high festival
once more.”</p>

<p>“Sir Peter was a dear,” said Miss Lawson. “I’ve
liked him ever since I saw that picture of him in the
drawing-room. And it’s a wonderful house, Mr.
Tuckerman. What are you going to do with it?
Are you going to live here?”</p>

<p>“I can’t very well,” Tuckerman answered, with
a shake of his head. “My home’s in the middle
West. I’m not like my Uncle Christopher and his
ancestors; I can’t live on an island in solitary grandeur.
I’m too fond of people.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you turn it into a show-place?”
suggested Milly Hallett. “That’s getting to be quite
the fashionable thing to do with colonial houses.”</p>

<p>“We’ve talked about that,” said Tuckerman.
His eyes roved over the fine room; and after a minute
he shook his head. “Cotterell Hall a museum? No,
I couldn’t do that. But I’ll tell you what I would
like to do. I’d like to come here every summer, and
have Tom and Ben and David camp out with me,
and have Joseph Hastings bring his house-parties
over here and spend a week as my guests.”</p>

<p>There were cheers from all the company, the
rafters rang with the noise as each and every one
shouted his or her acceptance. Hastings jumped to
his feet.</p>

<p>“In the name of us all I accept your invitation.
We will come, and dance in your drawing-room and
dine from your table, as they did in Sir Peter’s day.
And now, friends and fellow-citizens, I propose
three cheers—three long and rousing cheers—for
John Tuckerman!”</p>

<p>The cheers were given—long and rousing enough
to suit even Joseph Hastings.</p>

<p>Then the buff-coated man waved his hand. “As
your host for the evening, I invite you to go to the
drawing-room and dance something a little more
modern than the minuet. Miss Sarah Hooper, will
you do me the honor?”</p>

<p>Sarah and Mr. Hastings led the way across the
hall to the front room, where the rugs had been
removed from the polished floor. The music was a
piano and violin. And everybody danced, even
David, who contrived to jig about not too awkwardly
with Milly Hallett.</p>

<p>Then there were songs. Martin Locke sang the
ballad he had written, and Tuckerman sang, and Miss
Lawson sang several times. Presently Hastings
glanced at the clock. “I don’t like to mention it,”
said he, “but it’s almost midnight. To the boats,
to the boats, and away!”</p>

<p>They all trooped out to the creek, where the
flotilla was moored. Ladies in silks and satins and
beruffled gentlemen embarked. With cheers from
the shore, Joseph Hastings’ fleet steered down the
inlet and turned south.</p>

<p>Then the sailboat from Barmouth, with the
Halletts and Hoopers, flitted away from the landing-stage
on the other side of the island. The boys and
Tuckerman went along the shore to their camp.</p>

<p>“Great doings!” said Tom. “But how are
we ever going to keep Benjie busy now that the
treasure is found?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about me,” Ben retorted.
“I’ve got plenty to do. The sea is still full of fish.”</p>

<p>“He’s after a mahogany fish with long, skinny
legs,” said David.</p>

<p>“What I want to know,” said Ben, “is whether
there ever was a real mahogany man.”</p>

<p>“I think there was,” said Tuckerman. “But he
sailed away in the clipper ship. He probably went
to the Barbadoes.”</p>

<p>Tom gave a great yawn. “Well,” he said, “Ben
can sit up and talk about him as long as he likes; but
for me—I’m going to bed. It’s been what I’d call
a full day.”</p>

<h1 id='t8457'>XXI—THE BOYS AND JOHN TUCKERMAN</h1>

<p>Tuckerman pulled himself up on to the rock
where Tom and David and Ben were sitting in the
sun. The quiet of early morning was on the water; a
few terns were fishing for their breakfast; there was
the distant chug-chug of a lobsterman’s motor-boat
somewhere to the south; but otherwise the campers
had the shore and the bay to themselves. Tuckerman
sat down, sticking his long legs out in front of him.
“I may not be a duck,” he said, “but I’m certainly
getting web-feet. I feel almost as much at home in
the water as on dry land.”</p>

<p>“You’re a good swimmer,” said Tom. “In
fact, you’re an all-around sport. I don’t believe any
of the Cotterells knew a quarter as much about the
water as you do.”</p>

<p>“I can’t picture Sir Peter sunning himself on
this rock after a morning swim,” said David.</p>

<p>“Customs change with the times.” Tuckerman
slapped his wet knees. “But I can tell you I’m glad
I came on East this summer and learned to be a
real man.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Ben. “No, I didn’t mean it that
way. Of course you were a real man before. What
I mean is that the camp on your island has been a
great success. It’s taught me a lot.”</p>

<p>“Benjie, are you really going to be a professional
detective?” David inquired. “Seems to me I heard
someone say that you were thinking of it.”</p>

<p>“One mistake I made at first,” Ben remarked
solemnly, “was in thinking that the men who put
that chest in the rocks and those that Tom saw
leaving the island in the sailboat were the same
people. I thought there was only one set of men
prowling around here, when there were really two.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman smiled. “I don’t wonder you got
them mixed. Well, I’m glad Joseph Hastings’ guests
got their jewels back from those thieves.”</p>

<p>“You see,” Ben continued, following his own
line of thought, “the thieves came out here on the
night when Tom saw them in a sailboat, and not in
the fishing-smack. And I think it must have been
that same sailboat we saw close to the island the
night when we returned from Camp Amoussock in
the <span class='it'>Argo</span>.” He pried loose a sliver of rock and threw
it into the water. “Naturally, I didn’t connect that
sailboat with the fishing-smack.”</p>

<p>“You’re forgiven,” said Tom. “Don’t let that
weigh on your conscience.”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure,” suggested David, “but that we
ought to call Benjie the Professor and call Mr.
Tuckerman, John. Benjie’s getting to be a real
professor. Just listen to the way he talks.”</p>

<p>“Ever since he found the treasure——” began
Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, let up on a fellow, can’t you?” Ben interrupted.
“I haven’t mentioned the treasure to-day.”</p>

<p>David gave a chuckle. “You haven’t been out
of bed an hour yet. And that puts me in mind of
something important. Breakfast is waiting on
the beach.”</p>

<p>Four splashes of water as the campers dove from
the rock. Tuckerman could manage a very passable
dive now. A swim across to the beach, a rub-down,
a quick donning of clothes, and then preparations for
breakfast. “I’ve never known coffee to taste so
good as it does on Cotterell’s Island,” said
Tuckerman, draining his cup.</p>

<p>Tom looked up at the man with the horn-rimmed
spectacles. “Have you ever known anything to taste
so good as it does on Cotterell’s Island?” he asked
with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“No, now I come to think of it, I don’t believe I
ever have. It’s a wonderful place.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful cooking, you mean,” put in David.</p>

<p>“Wonderful fish,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“Just listen to them,” expostulated Tom. “Each
taking the credit to himself. When the fact of the
matter is that it’s all due to me. You’d never have
come out here, Professor, would you, if I hadn’t
agreed to come along?”</p>

<p>“Picture me alone here!” said Tuckerman.
“No, I didn’t believe I should. Alone on a deserted
island. It sounds all right in stories; but for practical
purposes give me three companions. Boys,
when I go back to my middle-western city I’ll think
a great deal about this summer on the coast.”</p>

<p>“It is pretty good here,” David admitted, looking
across the water to where a white sail was peeping
around a point of land. “And in winter there’s
fine skating.”</p>

<p>“And wonderful coasting,” said Ben. “There’s
a hill back of Barmouth where you can coast for
a mile.”</p>

<p>“And skiing,” Tom added. “You ought to be
good at that, Professor, you’ve got such long legs.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman put his hands to his ears. “Hold on,
hold on!” he exclaimed. “You overwhelm me.
Do you want to make me desert my home and business,
and do nothing but play?”</p>

<p>The three boys laughed. “We don’t play all the
time by any means,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” said David. “Sometimes we
wash the dishes.” And taking Ben by the collar of
his flannel shirt he lifted him to his feet. “Benjie’ll
show you how we do it.”</p>

<p>When they had cleaned the dishes they walked
over to Cotterell Hall. Tuckerman opened the front
door, which was unlocked. “While I was so very
particular about the key,” he chuckled, “both Joseph
Hastings and the crew of the fishing-smack were
coming in whenever they wanted. They made their
own keys to fit the locks. Well, I ought to have
been more hospitable.”</p>

<p>A week had passed since the famous party, and in
that week the police of Barmouth had found the
jewels that were stolen from the Gables, and also
duplicate keys to the front and back doors of Cotterell
Hall, hidden in the cabin of the fishing-smack. On
the strength of that, and of the testimony of Tom
and David and Lanky Larry as to what they had
seen on the afternoon when they were at the cove,
Sam and the other men had been held in jail for the
next term of court.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing,” said Ben, as the four went
into the big room on the left of the hall, “that
still puzzles me a bit. Why did Christopher Cotterell
write those lines in his notebook? ‘Find the mahogany-hued
man with the long, skinny legs and look in
his breast pocket. That’s a saying my father handed
down. What can it mean?’” Ben looked at the
others. “What do you suppose the mahogany man
did have in his pocket?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” said Tuckerman. “He
certainly didn’t have Sir Peter’s silver plate. That
may be one of those legends, Ben, that get changed
from their original meaning as they are handed down
from one to another.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that may be it,” agreed Ben, though
he did not look altogether satisfied.</p>

<p>“Every colonial house,” Tuckerman continued,
“ought to have some legend to make it interesting.
The mahogany man can be the legend of
Cotterell Hall.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman looked at the portrait of his ancestor.
“We’ve found what you meant by the place of the
three pines and the two rocks where the sun goes
down,” he said; “but we haven’t found what it was
that the mahogany man had in his breast pocket.
So you’ve still provided a conundrum for Ben to
puzzle over. Sir Peter, I don’t believe you’d have
any objection to our having found the plate. I think
that to-day you’d be as good an American as any
of the rest of us.”</p>

<p>“Of course he would,” said Tom, “I can understand
how he’d have objected to his neighbors telling
him to hand over his silver to them. I’d have
objected myself.”</p>

<p>Tuckerman turned to the three boys. “You
approve of Sir Peter, don’t you?” he asked. “Even
if he was a Tory?”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Ben promptly.</p>

<p>“I do,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“I think he was a corker, Professor,” said David.
“I wish he’d been in my family.”</p>

<p>“And that’s the opinion of three boys of good
old Barmouth families,” said Tuckerman with a
pleased smile. “Well, boys, you’re to feel free to
camp on Sir Peter’s island and use his house any time
you want.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Tom, “the next thing is to get the
Professor to sail us around to the north shore, so we
can get Mr. Hastings’ chest and bring it back to
the house. We don’t want to leave any tempting bait
for other prowlers to find.”</p>

<p>They went aboard the <span class='it'>Argo</span>, and Tuckerman
took the helm. He was now a proficient skipper, and
he gloried in it, as he gloried in all the new accomplishments
he had acquired in the past month.</p>

<p>The chest was brought to Cotterell Hall, and
again the <span class='it'>Argo</span> set sail. This time the three boys
fished, while Tuckerman handled the boat. Flounders
were biting in plenty, and soon they had enough for
dinner. Ben pulled in his line. “We’d better leave
some for another day,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“The wind’s just right for a southerly run,”
said Tom.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, Captain,” said Tuckerman, and
brought the bow about.</p>

<p>South they sailed, past the flag at Camp Amoussock,
past the cove with the shacks on each side,
past Joseph Hastings’ private dock, almost down to
Gosport before Tuckerman came about.</p>

<p>North to the island and dinner. And as they sat
on the bank afterwards and Tuckerman smoked his
pipe, he said, “Well, to-morrow I must start back
to the city. But I tell you, I’ve learned more since
I’ve camped out in Barmouth Harbor than I ever
learned in college.”</p>

<p>“If you stayed here much longer,” said David,
“you’d be almost as learned as Benjie.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” Tuckerman answered.
“I’m not as keen-witted as he is. I’m more lazy, like
you, Dave.”</p>

<p>David grinned. “Well, it takes something really
important to make me move around. I wouldn’t go
trailing a snuff-box all over the country.”</p>

<p>“It takes Lanky Larry’s pitching,” said Tom.
“Dave has to get mad before he does his best work.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t mad. I was cool as a cucumber,”
David responded. “I have a nice friendly nature.”</p>

<p>“If it hadn’t been for my following the snuffbox,”
Ben spoke up, “Joseph Hastings wouldn’t
have come out here and given his party; and if he
hadn’t given his party and told us to get our costumes
up in the attic, I wouldn’t have noticed that wallpaper;
and if I hadn’t noticed the wallpaper we’d
never have found the treasure. Q. E. D.”</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed David, “Ben’s off again!
No, Professor, I was wrong; you couldn’t possibly
be as learned as he is; nobody could.”</p>

<p>“I’ve half a mind to duck you for that,” said Ben.</p>

<p>“Come on!” retorted David, pretending to roll
up his sleeves.</p>

<p>“Only it’s too soon after dinner,” answered the
dark-haired boy. “I’ll overlook it this once; but
don’t you do it again.”</p>
